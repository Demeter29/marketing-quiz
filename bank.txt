Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Carol Veldt, owner of Seagull Terrace, watched her investment grow from a small, seaside
motel to a thriving year-round resort in just a few years. Atop a cliff overlooking the Maine
coast, Seagull Terrace had attracted thousands of visitors during summer, but then faced a
tremendous downturn in business during winter. "But, given the established industries in the
nearby towns, very little year-round competition, and our close proximity to Portland," Carol
added, "I couldn't understand why seasonality had to hit Seagull Terrace so hard!"
So Carol spent her first winter devising a new marketing plan. She put together a promotional
package designed to attract business travelers year-round. Carol's plan also involved a seasonal
promotional gimmick—to be implemented from early winter to late spring—that would attract
the same numbers as the large summer crowd. Her idea worked! During her second winter,
Carol greeted numerous business travelers—both satisfied repeat guests as well as new guests
who had been snagged by her promotional appeals.
"We still have a long way to go," Carol admitted. "Our delicatessen offers entrees that are a part
of the local cuisine, but we'd like to expand that. We provide health club privileges off-site, but
we'd like to eventually provide our own. These are goals I hope to achieve in a few years. Our
first project, however, included a renovation of our guest rooms and I'm quite proud of the
results." Carol then added, "Actually there are so many possibilities. With an indoor pool area, I
will eventually offer weekend getaways throughout winter."
18) Seagull Terrace offers its customers good accommodations, local delicacies, and amazing
seaside views. The overall experience provided at the motel is a part of its ________.
A) market offering
B) target market
C) market segment

28) Briefly compare and contrast the concepts of needs, wants, and demands and provide
examples to illustrate your answer. How do these three concepts relate to marketing practices?
Answer: Human needs are states of felt deprivation. Needs are a basic part of the human
makeup; they are not created by marketers. Humans have a basic physical need for food,
clothing, warmth, and safety; a basic social need for belonging and affection; and a basic
individual need for knowledge and self-expression. Wants are needs shaped by culture, society,
and individual personality. For example, an American needs food but wants a Big Mac and a soft
drink. Wants become demands when they are backed by consumers' buying power. For example,
an American with ten dollars needs food, wants a Big Mac and soft drink, and demands lunch at
McDonald's. Marketers conduct extensive research to understand customers' wants and demands.
They then attempt to fulfill customers' wants and demands through their market offerings.

30) Explain how and why marketers go beyond selling a product or service to create brand
experiences.
Answer: Sellers are most effective when they focus more on the benefits and experiences
produced by their products and services than on the specific products and services themselves.
Smart marketers focus on creating a brand experience, incorporating several products and
services for their customers. By doing so, marketers hope to increase customer satisfaction.
Satisfied customers buy again and tell others about their good experiences.

73) Company X, a manufacturer of office supplies, follows the selling concept. Explain how
the firm may lose sight of customer relationships with this marketing orientation.
Answer: The selling concept of Company X focuses on selling its office supplies rather than
making what the market wants; such a strategy creates sales transactions but not long-term
customer relationships. The company would most likely have a faulty assumption that
customers who are persuaded to buy the product will like it or that they will buy the product
again later even if they weren't really initially satisfied. Company X will not foster customer
loyalty with this approach.

75) Compare the selling and marketing concepts, listing the key components of each
philosophy.
Answer: The selling concept reflects an inside-out perspective, while the marketing concept
takes an outside-in perspective. The selling concept is typically practiced when an organization
is marketing products or services that buyers do not normally think of purchasing, such as
insurance or blood donation. Aggressive selling focuses on creating sales transactions rather
than building long-term relationships with customers, with the aim of selling what the company
makes rather than making what the customer wants. The marketing concept, on the other hand,
is based upon identifying the needs and wants of target markets and then satisfying those needs
and wants better than competitors do. In contrast to the selling concept, marketing focuses on
the customer, not the product, as the path to profits.

76) Briefly explain the societal marketing concept. Give an example of an organization that has
effectively used the societal marketing concept.
Answer: According to this concept, firms will succeed if they take underlying consumer needs
and society's well-being into account over the long term. A pure marketing concept can damage
consumers' long-run welfare by focusing exclusively on satisfying consumers' short-run wants.
Over a long period of time, this too-narrow focus can be damaging to the company. In setting
their marketing strategies, marketers today need to balance company profits, consumer wants,
and society's interests. The societal marketing concept holds that marketing strategy should
deliver value to customers in a way that maintains or improves both the consumer's and
society's well-being. It calls for sustainable marketing, socially and environmentally
responsible marketing that meets the present needs of consumers and businesses while also
preserving or enhancing the ability of future generations to meet their needs. UPS has a mission
that stresses economic prosperity, social responsibility, and environmental stewardship. The
company proactively seeks opportunities to act responsibly and efficiently. For example, UPS
works to make its operations "green" and supports employees volunteering in their
communities.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Carol Veldt, owner of Seagull Terrace, watched her investment grow from a small, seaside
motel to a thriving year-round resort in just a few years. Atop a cliff overlooking the Maine
coast, Seagull Terrace had attracted thousands of visitors during summer, but then faced a
tremendous downturn in business during winter. "But, given the established industries in the
nearby towns, very little year-round competition, and our close proximity to Portland," Carol
added, "I couldn't understand why seasonality had to hit Seagull Terrace so hard!"
So Carol spent her first winter devising a new marketing plan. She put together a promotional
package designed to attract business travelers year-round. Carol's plan also involved a seasonal
promotional gimmick—to be implemented from early winter to late spring—that would attract
the same numbers as the large summer crowd. Her idea worked! During her second winter,
Carol greeted numerous business travelers—both satisfied repeat guests as well as new guests
who had been snagged by her promotional appeals.
"We still have a long way to go," Carol admitted. "Our delicatessen offers entrees that are a part
of the local cuisine, but we'd like to expand that. We provide health club privileges off-site, but
we'd like to eventually provide our own. These are goals I hope to achieve in a few years. Our
first project, however, included a renovation of our guest rooms and I'm quite proud of the
results." Carol then added, "Actually there are so many possibilities. With an indoor pool area, I
will eventually offer weekend getaways throughout winter."
114) Carol Veldt's plan also involves a seasonal promotional gimmick that she wants to
promote aggressively. This is an example of the ________ concept.
A) selling

126) Explain what marketers can expect from individuals in the customer relationship group
classified as "butterflies."
Answer: "Butterflies" are profitable but not loyal. Marketers should enjoy this type of customer
"for the moment" because they soon flutter off. Marketers should create profitable and satisfying
transactions with "butterflies," then cease investing in them until the next time around. Marketers
can expect transactions with butterflies when conditions are optimal, but they should not expect
butterflies to become loyal customers.

127) Describe and compare the four types of customers classified by their potential profitability
to an organization. Explain how an organization should manage each type of customer.
Answer: The four types of customers are strangers, butterflies, true friends, and barnacles.
"Strangers" have low potential profitability and loyalty. A company's offerings do not fit well
with a stranger's wants and demands. Companies should not invest in building a relationship with
this type of customer. Another type of customer in which a company should not invest is the
"barnacle." Barnacles are highly loyal but not very profitable because there is a limited fit
between their needs and the company's offerings. The company might be able to improve
barnacles' profitability by selling them more, raising their fees, or reducing service to them.
However, if they cannot be made profitable, they should be "fired." Like strangers, "butterflies"
are not loyal. However, they are potentially profitable because there is a good fit between the
company's offerings and their needs. Like real butterflies, this type of customer will come and go
without becoming a permanent, loyal consumer of a company's products. Companies should use
promotional blitzes to attract these customers, create satisfying and profitable transactions with
them, and then cease investing in them until the next time around. The final type of customers is
"true friends"; they are both profitable and loyal. There is a strong fit between their needs and the
company's offerings, so the company should make continuous relationship investments in an
effort to go beyond satisfying and to delight these customers. A company should try to convert
true friends into customer evangelists who tell others about their good experiences with the
company.

131) Define customer relationship management and explain its associated tools and levels of
relationships.
Answer: Customer relationship management is the process of building and maintaining
profitable customer relationships by delivering superior customer value and satisfaction. A
company with mostly low-margin customers is likely to seek basic relationships, using brand-
building advertising, public relations, and so on. An organization with few customers and high
margins, on the other hand, will work to create full partnerships with key customers. To create
stronger bonds with customers, some companies offer frequency marketing programs that
reward customers who buy frequently or in large amounts. Other companies sponsor club
marketing programs that offer members special benefits and create member communities.

132) Explain why the aim of customer relationship management is to create not just customer
satisfaction, but also customer delight.
Answer: Customer satisfaction cannot be taken for granted. Because brand loyalty is
dependent upon strong customer satisfaction, companies strive to retain, satisfy, and even
delight current customers. Outstanding marketing companies go out of their way to keep
important customers satisfied. Most studies show that higher levels of customer satisfaction
lead to greater customer loyalty, which in turn results in better company performance. Firms
create customer delight by promising only what they can deliver and then delivering more than
what they promised. They also create emotional relationships with key customers. Delighted
customers make repeated purchases and become willing marketing partners and "customer
evangelists" who tell other potential customers about their positive experiences with the
product.

133) Define customer equity and explain how a company can increase it.
Answer: Customer equity is the sum of the lifetime values of all of the company's current and
potential customers. It's a measure of the future value of the company's customer base. Clearly,
the more loyal the firm's profitable customers, the higher its customer equity. Customer equity
may be a better measure of a firm's performance than current sales or market share. To increase
customer equity, companies should work to delight their customers and establish full
relationships with their most profitable customers.

152) Discuss the challenges and advantages of new communication technologies for marketers
as they work to build relationships with their customers.
Answer: Through the Internet and related technologies, people can now interact in direct and
surprisingly personal ways with large groups of others, from neighbors within a local
community to people across the world. With communication technologies such as e-mail,
blogs, Web sites, online communities, and online social networks, today's marketers
incorporate interactive approaches that help build targeted, two-way customer relationships.
Marketers can create deeper consumer involvement and a sense of community surrounding a
brand, making a brand a meaningful part of consumers' conversations and lives. However,
while new communication tools create relationship-building opportunities for marketers, they
also create challenges. They give consumers a greater voice, and therefore greater power and
control in the marketplace. In fact, the marketing world is beginning to embrace customer-
managed relationships. Today's consumers have more information about brands than ever
before, and they have a wealth of platforms for airing and sharing their brand views with other
consumers. This benefits companies when views of its products are positive, but can be
damaging when customers share stories of negative experiences with a company's products.

corporate level, the company starts the strategic planning process by defining its overall
purpose and mission. This mission is then turned into detailed supporting objectives that guide
the entire company. Next, headquarters decides what portfolio of businesses and products is
best for the company and how much support to give each one. In turn, each business and
product develops detailed marketing and other departmental plans that support the company-
wide plan. Thus, marketing planning occurs at the business-unit, product, and market levels. It
supports company strategic planning with more detailed plans for specific marketing
opportunities.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Fun-Spot Fun Park began as a small amusement park in 1985. With nothing more than a merry-
go-round, a slide, pony rides, and an ice cream stand, Fun-Spot grew into a popular family
attraction with 20 rides, a restaurant, and an outdoor performing arts theater.
"My wife, Gail, and I didn't know what we were getting into," commented Ron Hart, the owner.
"We just knew that weekenders coming to the lakes in our rural area represented an untapped
market."
Today, thousands of visitors flock to Fun-Spot: families, children of all ages, and even senior
citizens who enjoy strolling through the gardens and the arbors. "There's something here for
everyone," Gail Hart said with a smile. "Dozens of companies hold annual company picnics
here. We have welcomed class field trips. And we even had one wedding here at the park!"
"Here's the funny thing," Ron chimed in. "We really don't know why we've been so successful.
There is nothing else like Fun-Spot Fun Park in the area. We were just lucky." "I think it's the
ambience of the park that has brought so many visitors," Gail added. "We provide a 'total
package' of entertainment. Plus, we try to change our rides and various attractions from time to
time for variety."
Ron and Gail Hart admitted that making every visitor happy is a priority. "That has always been
our philosophy," they said. "Like the park's motto at the entrance reads, 'We're here to make you
happy!' And we've always been able to deliver on that because we've never allowed ourselves
to grow too big too quickly."

82) What is a growth-share matrix? Discuss the BCG growth-share matrix.
Answer: The growth-share matrix is a portfolio-planning method that evaluates a company's
SBUs in terms of market growth rate and relative market share. Using the now-classic Boston
Consulting Group (BCG) approach, a company classifies all its SBUs according to the growth-
share matrix. On the vertical axis, market growth rate provides a measure of market
attractiveness. On the horizontal axis, relative market share serves as a measure of company
strength in the market. The growth-share matrix defines four types of SBUs:
1. Stars are high-growth, high-share businesses or products. They often need heavy investments
to finance their rapid growth. Eventually their growth will slow down, and they will turn into
cash cows.
2. Cash cows are low-growth, high-share businesses or products. These established and
successful SBUs need less investment to hold their market share. Thus, they produce a lot of
the cash that the company uses to pay its bills and support other SBUs that need investment.
3. Question marks are low-share business units in high-growth markets. They require a lot of
cash to hold their share, let alone increase it. Management has to think hard about which
question marks it should try to build into stars and which should be phased out.
4. Dogs are low-growth, low-share businesses and products. They may generate enough cash to
maintain themselves but do not promise to be large sources of cash.

Answer: The BCG and other formal methods revolutionized strategic planning. However, such
centralized approaches have limitations: They can be difficult, time-consuming, and costly to
implement. Management may find it difficult to define SBUs and measure market share and
growth. In addition, these approaches focus on classifying current businesses but provide little
advice for future planning.

129) What is a marketing strategy? How do marketing strategies help firms?
Answer: Marketing strategy refers to the marketing logic by which the company hopes to
create this customer value and achieve these profitable relationships. A company decides which
customers it will serve (segmentation and targeting) and how (differentiation and positioning).
It identifies the total market and then divides it into smaller segments, selects the most
promising segments, and focuses on serving and satisfying the customers in these segments.
Guided by marketing strategy, a company designs an integrated marketing mix made up of
factors under its control—product, price, place, and promotion (the four Ps). To find the best
marketing strategy and mix, the company engages in marketing analysis, planning,
implementation, and control. Through these activities, the company watches and adapts to the
actors and forces in the marketing environment.

evaluating each market segment's attractiveness and selecting one or more segments to enter. A

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Fun-Spot Fun Park began as a small amusement park in 1985. With nothing more than a merry-
go-round, a slide, pony rides, and an ice cream stand, Fun-Spot grew into a popular family
attraction with 20 rides, a restaurant, and an outdoor performing arts theater.
"My wife, Gail, and I didn't know what we were getting into," commented Ron Hart, the owner.
"We just knew that weekenders coming to the lakes in our rural area represented an untapped
market."
Today, thousands of visitors flock to Fun-Spot: families, children of all ages, and even senior
citizens who enjoy strolling through the gardens and the arbors. "There's something here for
everyone," Gail Hart said with a smile. "Dozens of companies hold annual company picnics
here. We have welcomed class field trips. And we even had one wedding here at the park!"
"Here's the funny thing," Ron chimed in. "We really don't know why we've been so successful.
There is nothing else like Fun-Spot Fun Park in the area. We were just lucky." "I think it's the
ambience of the park that has brought so many visitors," Gail added. "We provide a 'total
package' of entertainment. Plus, we try to change our rides and various attractions from time to
time for variety."
Ron and Gail Hart admitted that making every visitor happy is a priority. "That has always been
our philosophy," they said. "Like the park's motto at the entrance reads, 'We're here to make you
happy!' And we've always been able to deliver on that because we've never allowed ourselves
to grow too big too quickly."
131) Which of the following would be classified as an opportunity in a SWOT analysis of Fun-
Spot?
A) A rival amusement park announces plans to open three new rides next season.
B) A new luxury hotel is being constructed in the area, with the aim of attracting more high-
spending families on vacation.
C) Ron and Gail have paid off the mortgage on Fun-Spot, significantly reducing their monthly
expenses.
D) Fun-Spot employees tend to be enthusiastic and young, projecting an image of fun and
vitality.
E) Fun-Spot plans to further diversify its offerings by beginning a two-week summer camp for
elementary school students.

167) Describe the most common forms of marketing organizations.
Answer: Modern marketing departments can be arranged in several ways.
1. The most common form of marketing organization is the functional organization. Under this
organization, different marketing activities are headed by a functional specialist—a sales
manager, an advertising manager, a marketing research manager, a customer service manager,
or a new product manager.
2. A company that sells across the country or internationally often uses a geographic
organization. Its sales and marketing people are assigned to specific countries, regions, and
districts. Geographic organization allows salespeople to settle into a territory, get to know their
customers, and work with a minimum of travel time and cost.
3. Companies with many very different products or brands often create a product management
organization. Using this approach, a product manager develops and implements a complete
strategy and marketing program for a specific product or brand.
4. For companies that sell one product line to many different types of markets and customers
who have different needs and preferences, a market or customer management organization
might be best. A market management organization is similar to the product management
organization.
Large companies that produce many different products flowing into many different geographic
and customer markets usually employ some combination of the functional, geographic, product,
and market organization forms.

169) How do marketers measure return on marketing investment? Why is this figure difficult to
assess?
Answer: Marketing ROI (return on investment) is the net return from a marketing investment
divided by the costs of the marketing investment. It measures the profits generated by
investments in marketing activities. Marketing ROI can be difficult to measure. In measuring
financial ROI, both the "R" and the "I" are uniformly measured in dollars. As of yet, however,
there is no consistent definition of marketing ROI. For instance, returns like advertising and
brand-building impact aren't easily put into dollar returns.
Increasingly, however, beyond standard performance measures, marketers are using customer-
centered measures of marketing impact, such as customer acquisition, customer retention,
customer lifetime value, and customer equity. These measures capture not only current
marketing performance but also future performance resulting from stronger customer
relationships.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Casey Brickly opened The Landing, a convenience store on the north shore of Witmer Lake, in
1962. With a sandwich counter on one side and a bait shop and grocery on the other, The
Landing was an immediate hit with weekend lake visitors and local residents alike. In the
summer, boaters parked at the piers and bought all their fishing needs, such as rods and reels,
bait, snacks, and soft drinks at The Landing. Even during the winter months, snowmobilers and
ice fishermen were lured to The Landing for snacks and hot coffee or hot chocolate.
As time passed, the business changed and grew tremendously. What was formerly a weekend
tourist area gradually became a full-fledged residential area. Many of the houses, which were
built as cottages in the 1950s and 1960s, were remodeled into residential homes. By the end of
the 1970s, the days of small motorboats and 10 mile-per-hour speed limits were gone; skiing
and fast speedboats became the rage. Through it all, The Landing continued to attract flocks of
patrons.
In the 1980s, however, Casey started to realize that the grocery area in The Landing could not
compete with larger local retailers. He eventually enlarged the sandwich counter, transforming
the bait shop and grocery into a restaurant with a full menu typical of any diner. "Getting rid of
the bait shop was hard to do," Casey admitted. "I still had a summer crowd that relied on us for
their fishing needs, but we couldn't survive a whole year on four months of profit."
In the early 2000s, the atmosphere of Witmer Lake and the neighboring lakes became upscale.
"I could see that people were spending more on their speed boats than what they had originally
paid for their cottages!" Casey exclaimed. Many of the cottages were inherited by children and
grandchildren of the original owners. Once again, the scene started to change as many of the
lake houses were used only as weekend lake homes. Unlike the previous generation, a vast
number of the current owners could afford to live closer to their jobs while maintaining lake
homes. "At this point, business wasn't growing," Casey said.
As local competition continued to increase, Casey converted the diner of The Landing into a
bar with a lounge area. "The change might have been too drastic," Casey said, "but it was the
only way we could maintain a strong, year-round business in spite of the population shifts and
competitive forces."
28) Which of the following microenvironment actors has had the most influence on The
Landing?
A) competitors
B) suppliers
C) marketing intermediaries

44) Who are the major players in a company's microenvironment? Explain the role that each
13
actor plays.
Answer: Marketing success requires building relationships with other company departments,
suppliers, marketing intermediaries, competitors, various publics, and customers, which
combine to make up the company's value delivery network.
The company: In designing marketing plans, marketing management takes other company
groups into account—groups such as top management, finance, research and development
(R&D), purchasing, operations, and accounting. All of these interrelated groups form the
internal environment. Top management sets the company's mission, objectives, broad strategies,
and policies. Marketing managers make decisions within the broader strategies and plans made
by top management.
Suppliers: Suppliers form an important link in the company's overall customer value delivery
network. They provide the resources needed by the company to produce its goods and services.
Marketing intermediaries: Marketing intermediaries help the company promote, sell, and
distribute its products to final buyers. They include resellers, physical distribution firms,
marketing services agencies, and financial intermediaries.
Competitors: The marketing concept states that, to be successful, a company must provide
greater customer value and satisfaction than its competitors do. Thus, marketers must do more
than simply adapt to the needs of target consumers.
Publics: The company's marketing environment also includes various publics. A public is any
group that has an actual or potential interest in or impact on an organization's ability to achieve
its objectives.
Customers: Customers are the most important actors in the company's microenvironment. The
aim of the entire value delivery network is to serve target customers and create strong
relationships with them.

Answer: Marketing intermediaries help the company promote, sell, and distribute its products
to final buyers. They include resellers, physical distribution firms, marketing services agencies,
and financial intermediaries.
Resellers are distribution channel firms that help the company find customers or make sales to
them. These include wholesalers and retailers who buy and resell merchandise.
Physical distribution firms help the company to stock and move goods from their points of
origin to their destinations. Marketing services agencies are the marketing research firms,
advertising agencies, media firms, and marketing consulting firms that help the company target
and promote its products to the right markets.
Financial intermediaries include banks, credit companies, insurance companies, and other
businesses that help finance transactions or insure against the risks associated with the buying
and selling of goods.

46) What is a "public" in terms of the marketing environment? In a short essay, briefly describe
the different types of publics that marketers must consider and explain how marketing might
communicate with these publics.
Answer: A public is any group that has an actual or potential interest in or impact on an
organization's ability to achieve its objectives. There are seven types of publics.
Financial publics: This group influences the company's ability to obtain funds.
Media publics: This group carries news, features, and editorial opinions.
Government publics: Management must take government developments into account.
Marketers must often consult the company's lawyers on issues of product safety, truth in
advertising, and other matters.
Citizen-action publics: A company's marketing decisions may be questioned by consumer
organizations, environmental groups, minority groups, and others. Its public relations
department can help it stay in touch with consumer and citizen groups.
Local publics: This group includes neighborhood residents and community organizations. Large
companies usually create departments and programs that deal with local community issues and
provide community support.
General public: A company needs to be concerned about the general public's attitude toward its
products and activities. The public's image of the company affects its buying.
Internal publics: This group includes workers, managers, volunteers, and the board of directors.
Large companies use newsletters and other means to inform and motivate their internal publics.
A company can prepare marketing plans for these major publics as well as for its customer
markets.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Casey Brickly opened The Landing, a convenience store on the north shore of Witmer Lake, in
1962. With a sandwich counter on one side and a bait shop and grocery on the other, The
Landing was an immediate hit with weekend lake visitors and local residents alike. In the
summer, boaters parked at the piers and bought all their fishing needs, such as rods and reels,
bait, snacks, and soft drinks at The Landing. Even during the winter months, snowmobilers and
ice fishermen were lured to The Landing for snacks and hot coffee or hot chocolate.
As time passed, the business changed and grew tremendously. What was formerly a weekend
tourist area gradually became a full-fledged residential area. Many of the houses, which were
built as cottages in the 1950s and 1960s, were remodeled into residential homes. By the end of
the 1970s, the days of small motorboats and 10 mile-per-hour speed limits were gone; skiing
and fast speedboats became the rage. Through it all, The Landing continued to attract flocks of
patrons.
In the 1980s, however, Casey started to realize that the grocery area in The Landing could not
compete with larger local retailers. He eventually enlarged the sandwich counter, transforming
the bait shop and grocery into a restaurant with a full menu typical of any diner. "Getting rid of
the bait shop was hard to do," Casey admitted. "I still had a summer crowd that relied on us for
their fishing needs, but we couldn't survive a whole year on four months of profit."
In the early 2000s, the atmosphere of Witmer Lake and the neighboring lakes became upscale.
"I could see that people were spending more on their speed boats than what they had originally
paid for their cottages!" Casey exclaimed. Many of the cottages were inherited by children and
grandchildren of the original owners. Once again, the scene started to change as many of the
lake houses were used only as weekend lake homes. Unlike the previous generation, a vast
number of the current owners could afford to live closer to their jobs while maintaining lake
homes. "At this point, business wasn't growing," Casey said.
As local competition continued to increase, Casey converted the diner of The Landing into a
bar with a lounge area. "The change might have been too drastic," Casey said, "but it was the
only way we could maintain a strong, year-round business in spite of the population shifts and
competitive forces."
81) Which of the following is the macroenvironmental force that has had the greatest effect on
The Landing?
A) the demographic environment
B) the technological environment
C) marketing intermediaries
D) the political environment

101) What is demography? Why is the demographic environment of major interest to
marketers? Discuss the changing age structure of the U.S. population.
Answer: Demography is the study of human populations in terms of size, density, location,
age, gender, race, occupation, and other statistics. The demographic environment is of major
interest to marketers because it involves people, and people make up markets. Marketers can
learn much about human populations in terms of changing age and family structures,
geographic population shifts, educational characteristics, population diversity, and other
statistics. Based on age structure, the U.S. population can be categorized into several
generational groups; the three largest among them are the baby boomers, Generation X, and the
Millennials. The baby boomer market of 78 million people is one of the most powerful forces
shaping the marketing environment. Considerably smaller than the boomer generation that
precedes them and the Millennials who follow, the Generation Xers are a sometimes
overlooked consumer group. Although they seek success, they are less materialistic than the
other groups; they prize experience, not acquisition. For many of the Gen Xers who are parents,
family comes first—both children and their aging parents—and career second. From a
marketing standpoint, the Gen Xers are a more skeptical bunch. They tend to research products
before they consider a purchase, prefer quality to quantity, and tend to be less receptive to overt
marketing pitches. They are more likely to be receptive to irreverent ad pitches that make fun of
convention and tradition. The Millennials (or Generation Y) are the 83 million children of the
baby boomers born between 1977 and 2000. One thing that all Millennials have in common is
their comfort with digital technology. They don't just embrace technology; it's a way of life.
Rather than having mass-marketing messages pushed at them, the Millennials prefer to seek out
information and engage in two-way brand conversations. Generation Zers make up important
kids, tweens, and teens markets that influence almost $200 billion of their own and parents'
spending. They are utterly fluent with technology and take it for granted. They are highly
mobile, connected, and social. They blend the online and offline worlds seamlessly as they
socialize and shop.

102) Explain the impact of the baby boomers, Generation Xers, Millennials, and Generation
Zers on today's marketing strategies.
Answer: Today's baby boomers account for about 26 percent of the U.S. population but control
an estimated 70 percent of the nation's disposable income. This group is an attractive market for
financial services, new housing and home remodeling, travel and entertainment, and health and
fitness products, among others. Generation Xers carry a more cautious outlook; they are less
materialistic than baby boomers, so marketers must use a different approach to appeal to them.
Millennials are children of the baby boomers. One thing that all Millennials have in common is
their comfort with digital technology. They don't just embrace technology; it's a way of life.
The Millennials were the first generation to grow up in a world filled with computers, mobile
phones, satellite TV, iPods and iPads, and online social networks. As a result, they engage with
brands in an entirely new way, such as with mobile or social media. Rather than having mass-
marketing messages pushed at them, the Millennials prefer to seek out information and engage
in two-way brand conversations. Thus, reaching them effectively requires creative marketing
approaches. Generation Zers are born after 2000 and make up important kids, tweens, and teens
markets that influence almost $600 billion of their own and parents' spending. They are utterly
fluent with technology and take it for granted. They are highly mobile, connected, and social.
They blend the online and offline worlds seamlessly as they socialize and shop.
Marketers need to form more precise age-specific segments within each group. More important,
defining people by their birth date may be less effective than segmenting them by their lifestyle,
life stage, or the common values they seek in the products they buy.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Casey Brickly opened The Landing, a convenience store on the north shore of Witmer Lake, in
1962. With a sandwich counter on one side and a bait shop and grocery on the other, The
Landing was an immediate hit with weekend lake visitors and local residents alike. In the
summer, boaters parked at the piers and bought all their fishing needs, such as rods and reels,
bait, snacks, and soft drinks at The Landing. Even during the winter months, snowmobilers and
ice fishermen were lured to The Landing for snacks and hot coffee or hot chocolate.
As time passed, the business changed and grew tremendously. What was formerly a weekend
tourist area gradually became a full-fledged residential area. Many of the houses, which were
built as cottages in the 1950s and 1960s, were remodeled into residential homes. By the end of
the 1970s, the days of small motorboats and 10 mile-per-hour speed limits were gone; skiing
and fast speedboats became the rage. Through it all, The Landing continued to attract flocks of
patrons.
In the 1980s, however, Casey started to realize that the grocery area in The Landing could not
compete with larger local retailers. He eventually enlarged the sandwich counter, transforming
the bait shop and grocery into a restaurant with a full menu typical of any diner. "Getting rid of
the bait shop was hard to do," Casey admitted. "I still had a summer crowd that relied on us for
their fishing needs, but we couldn't survive a whole year on four months of profit."
In the early 2000s, the atmosphere of Witmer Lake and the neighboring lakes became upscale.
"I could see that people were spending more on their speed boats than what they had originally
paid for their cottages!" Casey exclaimed. Many of the cottages were inherited by children and
grandchildren of the original owners. Once again, the scene started to change as many of the
lake houses were used only as weekend lake homes. Unlike the previous generation, a vast
number of the current owners could afford to live closer to their jobs while maintaining lake
homes. "At this point, business wasn't growing," Casey said.
As local competition continued to increase, Casey converted the diner of The Landing into a
bar with a lounge area. "The change might have been too drastic," Casey said, "but it was the
only way we could maintain a strong, year-round business in spite of the population shifts and
competitive forces."
114) Which of the following is the macroenvironmental force that benefitted The Landing the
most?
A) the legal environment
B) the natural environment
C) the economic environment
D) the political environment
E) the technological environment

Answer: Marketers who help develop solutions to problems facing the natural environment can

can be expected in the United States and elsewhere. Environmentally responsible actions will
help a company's public image; the actions will also help in creating a more sustainable market.

119) What are the major trends in today's natural environment? How do these trends affect
companies?
Answer: The natural environment shows three major trends: shortages of certain raw materials,
higher pollution levels, and more government intervention in natural resource management.
Environmental concerns create marketing opportunities for alert companies. As concern about
global warming and other environmental issues continues to grow, more and more consumers
are demanding environmentally responsible products. Companies who pay heed to these
demands will benefit, as environmentally responsible actions are linked with good business.

120) Why is the technological environment such a dramatic force in today's market?
Answer: The technological environment is perhaps the most dramatic force now shaping our
destiny. Technology has released such wonders as antibiotics, robotic surgery, miniaturized
electronics, smartphones, and the Internet. It also has released such horrors as nuclear missiles,
chemical weapons, and assault rifles. It has released such mixed blessings as the automobile,
television, and credit cards. Our attitude toward technology depends on whether we are more
impressed with its wonders or its blunders.
New technologies create new markets and opportunities. However, every new technology
replaces an older technology. Transistors hurt the vacuum-tube industry, digital photography
hurt the film business, and MP3 players and digital downloads are hurting the CD business.
When old industries fought or ignored new technologies, their businesses declined. Thus,
marketers should watch the technological environment closely. Companies that do not keep up
will soon find their products outdated. If that happens, they will miss new product and market
opportunities.

153) Discuss why business legislation is enacted. Provide examples.
Answer: Business legislation is enacted to protect companies from each other, to protect
consumers from unfair business practices, and to protect the interests of society against
unrestrained business behavior. Several laws are designed to prevent unfair competitive
practices between businesses; in the United States, these laws are enforced by the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) and the Antitrust Division of the Attorney General's office. An example of
such a law is the Sherman Antitrust Act that prohibits monopolies and other activities that
restrain trade. Laws to protect consumers are designed to prevent deceptive advertising,
packaging, and pricing, among other harmful practices. Examples of this type of law include
the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act and the Consumer Product Safety Act. Finally, regulations
to protect the interests of society require companies to take responsibility for the social costs of
their products and/or production practices. An example of this type of law is the National
Environmental Policy Act.

154) What is cause-related marketing? Illustrate with examples.
Answer: To exercise their social responsibility and build more positive images, many
companies are now linking themselves to worthwhile causes. Some companies are founded
entirely on cause-related missions. Under the concept of "values-led business" or "caring
capitalism," their mission is to use business to make the world a better place. Cause-related
marketing has become a primary form of corporate giving. It lets companies "do well by doing
good" by linking purchases of the company's products or services with benefiting worthwhile
causes or charitable organizations.
The P&G Tide Loads of Hope program provides mobile laundromats and loads of clean
laundry to families in disaster-stricken areas—P&G washes, dries, and folds clothes for these
families for free. Down the street, needy people will probably find the P&G Duracell Power

155) How do people's views of nature affect marketers?
Answer: People vary in their attitudes toward the natural world—some feel ruled by it, others
feel in harmony with it, and still others seek to master it. A long-term trend has been people's
growing mastery over nature through technology and the belief that nature is bountiful. More
recently, however, people have recognized that nature is finite and fragile; it can be destroyed
or spoiled by human activities.
This renewed love of things natural has created a sizable market of consumers who seek out
everything from natural, organic, and nutritional products to fuel-efficient cars and alternative
medicine. The U.S. organic/natural food market now generates $45 billion in annual retail sales
and will grow to an estimated $200 billion by 2019.

14) What do marketers gain from gathering and analyzing information about customers and the
needs and motivations of those customers?
Answer: To create value for customers and build meaningful relationships with them,
marketers must first gain fresh, deep insights into what customers need and want. Such
customer insights come from good marketing information. Companies use these customer
insights to develop a competitive advantage.
Customer insights groups collect customer and market information from a wide variety of
sources, ranging from traditional marketing research studies to mingling with and observing
consumers to monitoring social media conversations about the company and its products. They
mine big data from sources far and wide. Then they use this information to develop important
customer insights from which the company can create more value for its customers.

Answer: A marketing information system (MIS) consists of people and procedures dedicated to
assessing information needs, developing the needed information, and helping decision makers
use the information to generate and validate actionable customer and market insights.
The MIS begins and ends with information users—marketing managers, internal and external
partners, and others who need marketing information. First, it interacts with these information
users to assess information needs. Next, it interacts with the marketing environment to develop
needed information through internal company databases, marketing intelligence activities, and
marketing research. Finally, the MIS helps users to analyze and use the information to develop
customer insights, make marketing decisions, and manage customer relationships.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Jason West, owner of A1 Cleaning, started his enterprise in 2001. Jason's primary focus had
been on office cleaning for large corporations. But in recent months, Jason has seen a decline in
demand for his office cleaning services. Surprisingly, the competitive environment appeared
relatively stable with no new competitors. However, Jason knew that office cleaning was a
high-frequency service that is usually performed daily; therefore, competitors must have been
doing something to attract his customers. Building a competitive advantage seemed to be the
only option to offset competition. But as Jason pondered over his dilemma, he realized that
prior to building his competitive advantage he needed to better understand how customers
assessed service quality and what they look for in a superior cleaning service.
Jason developed a research plan. First, he gathered information about his competitors, primarily
through pamphlets and Web sites, as well as through a few phone calls in order to find out
exactly what the competitors offered in their cleaning packages. In addition, Jason obtained
from the Chamber of Commerce an updated list of local corporations. He planned on sending
written questionnaires to them.
Though the list of corporations contained 141 local company names, Jason chose to survey 75
of them. To better understand customer service expectations between both small and large
corporations, Jason divided his surveys into two categories. The survey questions were
designed to extract specific data from respondents with regard to service quality expectations in
correlation to service frequency and price.
Jason awaited the results. Though his primary focus had been on large corporations, he was
flexible and would aim his efforts differently if needed.
30) In this scenario, which of the following is representative of competitive marketing
intelligence?
A) formulating a research plan
B) collecting data about competitors
C) sending mail questionnaires to focus groups
D) creating competitive advantage
E) consolidating core competencies

38) Marketers can obtain information from internal data and from competitive marketing
intelligence. Compare and contrast the two sources of information.
Answer: Internal databases refer to electronic collections of consumer and market information
obtained from data sources within the company network. For example, the accounting
department provides records of sales, costs, and cash flows; operations reports on production-
related issues; sales and marketing provide data on resellers, competitors, buyer behavior, and
the industry; and marketing provides information on customer transactions, demographics, and
buying behavior. Internal data are cheaper sources that are easy to access.
On the other hand, competitive marketing intelligence refers to the systematic collection and
analysis of publicly available information about consumers, competitors, and developments in
the marketplace. The goal of competitive marketing intelligence is to improve strategic decision
making by understanding the consumer environment, assessing and tracking competitors'
actions, and providing early warnings of opportunities and threats. Marketing intelligence
techniques range from observing consumers firsthand to quizzing the company's own
employees, benchmarking competitors' products, researching the Internet, and monitoring
Internet buzz.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Jason West, owner of A1 Cleaning, started his enterprise in 2001. Jason's primary focus had
been on office cleaning for large corporations. But in recent months, Jason has seen a decline in
demand for his office cleaning services. Surprisingly, the competitive environment appeared
relatively stable with no new competitors. However, Jason knew that office cleaning was a
high-frequency service that is usually performed daily; therefore, competitors must have been
doing something to attract his customers. Building a competitive advantage seemed to be the
only option to offset competition. But as Jason pondered over his dilemma, he realized that
prior to building his competitive advantage he needed to better understand how customers
assessed service quality and what they look for in a superior cleaning service.
Jason developed a research plan. First, he gathered information about his competitors, primarily
through pamphlets and Web sites, as well as through a few phone calls in order to find out
exactly what the competitors offered in their cleaning packages. In addition, Jason obtained
from the Chamber of Commerce an updated list of local corporations. He planned on sending
written questionnaires to them.
Though the list of corporations contained 141 local company names, Jason chose to survey 75
of them. To better understand customer service expectations between both small and large
corporations, Jason divided his surveys into two categories. The survey questions were
designed to extract specific data from respondents with regard to service quality expectations in
correlation to service frequency and price.
Jason awaited the results. Though his primary focus had been on large corporations, he was
flexible and would aim his efforts differently if needed.
102) In this scenario, which of the following is an example of primary data?
A) list of corporations obtained from the Chamber of Commerce
B) information obtained from competitors' pamphlets
C) data obtained from the surveys conducted in the 75 companies
D) information obtained from the Internet about current market trends

116) What are the steps of the marketing research process? How do companies conduct
research?
Answer: The marketing research process involves four steps: defining the problem and
research objectives, developing the plan, implementing the research plan, and interpreting and
reporting the findings.
Some large companies have their own research departments that work with marketing managers
on marketing research projects. In addition, these companies—like their smaller counterparts—
frequently hire outside research specialists to consult with management on specific marketing
problems and to conduct marketing research studies. Sometimes firms simply purchase data
collected by outside firms to aid in their decision making.

117) Briefly compare the different types of research approaches for gathering primary data.
Answer: Research approaches for gathering primary data include observations, surveys, and
experiments.
Observational research involves gathering primary data by observing relevant people, actions,
and situations. Observations can reveal information that people are unwilling or unable to
provide in surveys or experiments.
Survey research, the most widely used method for primary data collection, is the approach best
suited for gathering descriptive information. A company that wants to know about people's
knowledge, attitudes, preferences, or buying behavior can often find out by asking them
directly. The major advantage of survey research is its flexibility; it can be used to obtain many
different kinds of information in many different situations. Surveys addressing almost any
marketing question or decision can be conducted by phone or mail, in person, or online.
Experimental research is best suited for gathering causal information. It involves selecting
matched groups of subjects, giving them different treatments, controlling unrelated factors, and
checking for differences in group responses. Experimental research tries to explain cause-and-
effect relationships.

119) Describe the major contact methods used to collect information from respondents in
market research.
Answer: Information can be collected by mail, telephone, personal interview, or online.
Mail questionnaires can be used to collect large amounts of information at a low cost per
respondent. Respondents may give more honest answers to more questions by mail than to an
unknown interviewer in person or on the phone. Also, no interviewer is involved to bias
respondents' answers.
Telephone interviewing is one of the best methods for gathering information quickly, and it
provides greater flexibility than mail questionnaires. Interviewers can explain difficult
questions and, depending on the answers they receive, skip some questions or probe on others.
Response rates tend to be higher than with mail questionnaires, and interviewers can ask to
speak to respondents with the desired characteristics or even by name.
Personal interviewing takes two forms: individual interviewing and group interviewing.
Individual interviewing involves talking with people in their homes or offices, on the street, or
in shopping malls. Such interviewing is flexible. Group interviewing consists of inviting 6 to 10
people to meet with a trained moderator to talk about a product, service, or organization.
Participants normally are paid a small sum for attending. A moderator encourages free and easy
discussion, hoping that group interactions will bring out actual feelings and thoughts.
Online research can take many forms. A company can use the Internet or mobile technology as
a survey medium: It can include a questionnaire on its Web or social media sites or use e-mail
or mobile devices to invite people to answer questions. It can create online panels that provide
regular feedback or conduct live discussions or online focus groups. Researchers can also
conduct online experiments.

Answer: Designing the sample requires three decisions. First, who is to be studied (what

Second, how many people should be included (what sample size)? Large samples give more
reliable results than small samples. However, larger samples usually cost more, and it is not
necessary to sample the entire target market or even a large portion to get reliable results.
Finally, how should the people in the sample be chosen (what sampling procedure)?

among them. Examples include multiple-choice questions and scale questions. Open-ended
questions allow respondents to answer in their own words. Open-ended questions are especially
useful in exploratory research, when the researcher is trying to find out what people think but is
not measuring how many people think in a certain way. Closed-ended questions, on the other
hand, provide answers that are easier to interpret and tabulate.

144) How can a company manage information on specific customers more effectively?
Answer: Many companies are now turning to customer relationship management (CRM) to
manage detailed information about individual customers and carefully manage customer touch
points to maximize customer loyalty. By using sophisticated software and analytical tools,
information about customers can be integrated from all sources and analyzed in depth, and the
results can be applied to build stronger customer relationships. CRM integrates everything that
a company's sales, service, and marketing teams know about individual customers to provide a
360-degree view of the customer relationship. Moreover, CRM analysts use analysis tools,
technologies, and processes to dig out meaningful patterns in big data to gain customer insights
and gauge marketing performance.

Answer: The most common CRM mistake is to view CRM as technology processes only.
Companies can't improve customer relationships by simply installing some new software.
Instead, marketers should start with the fundamentals of managing customer relationships and
then employ high-tech data and analytics solutions. They should focus on the customer
relationship, the central aspect of CRM.

158) Discuss how small businesses and not-for-profit organizations can obtain market insights
economically.
Answer: Small businesses and not-for-profit organizations can obtain good marketing insights
through observation or informal surveys using small convenience samples. Also, many
associations, local media, and government agencies provide special help to small organizations.
Finally, small businesses can collect a considerable amount of information at very little cost
online. They can scour competitor and customer Web sites and use Internet search engines to
research specific companies and issues. In summary, secondary data collection, observation,
surveys, and experiments can all be used effectively by small organizations with small budgets.
However, although these informal research methods are less complex and less costly, they still
must be conducted with care. Managers must think carefully about the objectives of the
research, formulate questions in advance, recognize the biases introduced by smaller samples
and less skilled researchers, and conduct the research systematically.

159) Explain the common problems that international marketing researchers encounter.
Answer: International researchers deal with less homogeneous markets. The markets often
vary greatly in their levels of economic development, cultures and customers, and buying
patterns. Good secondary data are difficult to find in many foreign markets. Because of the
scarcity of good secondary data, international researchers often must collect their own primary
data. In addition, choosing representative samples and finding methods of contacting
participants can be a formidable task. Cultural and language differences can present obstacles in
interpreting the data and drawing realistic conclusions. Consumers' attitudes in other countries
may hinder the process of collection.

Answer: Although some consumers actually enjoy being interviewed and giving their opinions,
others strongly resent or even mistrust marketing research. They don't like being interrupted by
researchers. They worry that marketers are building huge databases full of personal information
about customers. Or they fear that researchers might use sophisticated techniques to probe our
deepest feelings, peek over our shoulders as we shop, or track us as we browse and interact on
the Internet and then use this knowledge to manipulate our buying.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
The Attic Trunk opened in 1999 as an upscale dress shop in Forest Ridge's fashionable
shopping district, catering to a wealthy, mature clientele consisting mostly of older, first-
generation Hispanics. Many other specialty shops lined the main avenue over the next few
years. But as Forest Ridge began to attract a more price-conscious, younger, and more
demographically diverse population, the once-popular shopping district was increasingly
perceived as stodgy and snobby by the new segment of customers.
By the mid-2000s, many of these specialty shops suffered financially. Most shops attracted only
tourists who enjoyed browsing through the displays of alligator belts and shoes, piles of scented
soaps, and so on, often laughing at the ridiculously high prices.
Owners of The Attic Trunk had noticed the shifts in buying behavior of customers by the mid-
2000s. In fact, the owners had observed that the once-fashionable shopping district in Forest
Ridge no longer attracted the wealthy, mature clientele. This clientele had been replaced with
price-conscious families with children, a mix of Asian and African Americans as well as
Caucasians.
Specialty items at The Attic Trunk gradually disappeared, replaced by brand-name apparel,
fashion accessories, and jewelry. Other owners followed suit in the late 2000s, bringing
restaurants, an outdoor cafe, and a day spa to the main avenue in Forest Ridge.
77) Which of the following best supports the idea that The Attic Trunk's mature, wealthy
clientele can remain a viable target market?
A) Older, first generation Hispanic consumers are not especially family-oriented.
B) Older, first-generation Hispanic consumers favor sellers who show special interest in them.
C) Older, first generation Hispanic consumers tend to be very price conscious.
D) Older, first generation Hispanic consumers tend to display little brand loyalty.
E) Older, first generation Hispanic consumers are motivated by mainstream marketing.

opened, husband-wife involvement in the buying process has remained relatively unchanged.
B) Children have considerable amounts of disposable income and have a strong influence on
family buying decisions.
C) Women seldom account for any technology-related purchases.
D) Women typically account for most habitual purchases.

needs to understand the role played by the buyer's culture, subculture, and social class.
Distinguish between culture, subculture, and social class.
Answer: Culture is the most basic cause of a person's wants and behavior. Each culture
contains smaller subcultures, or groups of people with shared value systems based on common
life experiences and situations. Subcultures include nationalities, religions, racial groups, and
geographic regions. Many subcultures make up important markets. Social classes are society's
relatively permanent and ordered divisions whose members share similar values, interests, and
behaviors. Unlike nationality or ethnic subculture, social class is determined by a combination
of many variables, such as occupation, income, education, and wealth.

family affair. The older, first-generation consumers tend to be very brand loyal and favor
companies who show special interest in them. African American consumers are more price-
conscious than other segments; they are also strongly motivated by quality and selection. Asian
American consumers are the most affluent U.S. demographic segment and are the second
fastest-growing population subculture, after Hispanic Americans. Asian American consumers
are the most brand conscious of all the ethnic groups. They can be fiercely brand loyal.

104) A consumer's behavior is influenced by social factors, such as the consumer's small
groups, family, and social roles and status. Explain the differences among these social factors.
Answer: Small groups to which a person belongs have a direct influence on what a person
buys. Reference groups serve as direct or indirect points of comparison or reference in forming
a person's attitudes or behaviors. An aspirational group is one to which the individual wishes to
belong. Reference groups expose a person to new behaviors and lifestyles, influence a person's
attitudes and self-concept, and create pressures to conform that may affect the person's product
and brand choices. Opinion leaders are people within a reference group who, because of special
skills, knowledge, personality, or other characteristics, exert social influence on others. The
group closest to consumers is the family, the most important consumer buying organization in
society. Marketers are interested in the changing roles and influence of each family member on
the purchase of different products and services. Within groups, including families, the position
of an individual is defined by role and status. A role consists of the activities people are
expected to perform according to the persons around them, while status is the general esteem
given to that role. People tend to choose products that fit with their roles and status.

105) Explain the change in buying roles of husbands and wives due to an evolving consumer
lifestyle in the United States. Additionally, describe the effect of this change on marketers.
Answer: In the United States, the wife traditionally has been considered the main purchasing
agent for the family in the areas of food, household products, and clothing. However, with more
women working outside the home and the willingness of husbands to do more of the family's
purchasing, all this is changing. A recent survey of men ages 18 to 64 found that 41 percent
identify themselves as primary grocery shoppers in their households and about 39 percent
handle most of their household's laundry. At the same time, today women account for 60
percent of all technology purchases and influence 80 percent of all new car purchases. Such
shifting roles signal a new marketing reality. Marketers in industries that have traditionally sold
their products to only women or only men—from groceries and personal care products to cars
and consumer electronics—are now carefully targeting the opposite sex.

106) People's distinct individual personalities influence their buying behavior. Personality is

people purchase items? Give at least one example.
Answer: Personality is described in terms of traits such as self-confidence, dominance,
sociability, autonomy, defensiveness, adaptability, and aggressiveness. Personality can be useful
in analyzing consumer behavior for certain products. Consumers are likely to choose brands
with personalities that match their own. For example, someone with a sophisticated personality
might be attracted to a more sophisticated product, such as a BMW, while someone with a more
rugged personality might be attracted to a more rugged product, such as a Jeep.

self-esteem, and self-actualization needs. Maslow suggested that individuals meet the bottom-
level, basic needs first before moving up the hierarchy. Until more basic needs such as safety
are fulfilled, an individual has little interest in higher-level needs such as esteem and self-

145) Compare and contrast the four types of buying decision behavior exhibited by consumers.
Answer: Consumers exhibit complex buying behavior when they are highly involved in a
purchase decision and perceive significant differences among the choices. Consumers will
engage in a learning process as they gather and analyze information about their choices before
making a purchase. When a consumer is highly involved with a purchase but does not perceive
significant differences among her choices, he/she will most likely engage in dissonance-
reducing behavior. This behavior involves less time learning about each product's attributes,
and a consumer is more likely to make a choice based on a good price or convenience. Habitual
buying behavior and variety-seeking behavior are exhibited when a consumer has a low
involvement with the product. When the consumer sees little difference between brands, he/she
will most likely engage in habitual buying behavior, buying the most familiar brands out of
habit. When the consumer perceives some significant brand differences, he/she is more likely to
engage in variety-seeking buying behavior, doing a lot of brand switching without a great deal
of evaluation before purchase.

146) Describe some important strategies for a marketer of a high-involvement product.
Answer: Marketers must understand the information-gathering and evaluation behavior of their
high-involvement customers. This involves helping customers learn about the product attributes
and their relative importance, as well as clearly differentiating the brand's features. Marketers
might use long copy in print media to satisfy the customer's need for information. Marketers
must also motivate salespeople to influence the customer's choice. To discourage customers'
postpurchase dissonance, after-sale communications from the marketer should help customers
feel good about their purchase decision.

147) Listing them in the proper order, what are the stages in the buyer decision process?
Describe each.
Answer: In the need recognition stage, consumers become aware of a new problem or need.
Then, consumers seek information about products to meet that need in the information search
stage. In the alternative evaluation stage, consumers use the gathered information to compare
and contrast the choices. Consumers do not use the same evaluation process in all buying
situations; sometimes they may make careful, logical calculations and other times they may
rely on intuition and buy on impulse. Consumers then make the purchase decision, buying the
product. The last component of the process is postpurchase behavior, which is determined by
any difference between the consumer's expectations for the product and the perceived
performance of the product.

characteristic affects the rate of adoption.
Answer: The five most important product characteristics that influence the rate of a product's
adoption are relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, divisibility, and communicability.
Relative advantage is the degree to which an innovation appears superior to existing products;
the greater the perceived relative advantage, the sooner the product will be adopted.
Compatibility is the degree to which the innovation fits the values and experiences of potential
consumers; high compatibility leads to quick adoption. Complexity is the degree to which the
innovation is difficult to understand or use; the greater the complexity, the slower the adoption
rate. Divisibility is the degree to which the innovation may be tried on a limited basis; the
higher the divisibility, the slower the rate of adoption. Finally, communicability is the degree to
which the results of using the innovation can be observed or described to others; high
communicability leads to a higher rate of adoption.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Alpha Stampings Inc. produces 14 metal stampings for the automotive industry. Due to industry
design changes and consumer demands, for the next financial year, six of those stampings will
require a slight change: two will have an extra hole punched through the side, two will require
an extra plating process, and two will require an additional weld operation.
In the meantime, purchasing agent Richard Koehl has been asked to reduce the number of
Alpha's steel suppliers in an effort to cut costs. After obtaining updated price quotations and
steel samples from his current suppliers, Richard faced a dilemma. Until now, he had selected
his suppliers based on quality and price, but the major consideration had been the type of steel
required and the specialized production processes of his respective suppliers. Not all of Alpha's
suppliers could produce the exact grades of steel needed; some suppliers were better at
producing certain types of steel than others.
Richard contacted several employees at Alpha who had worked with the various types of steel
in the past. The quality control manager and line inspector, for example, could help to
determine which suppliers had the capabilities of producing specific types of steel. The
production control manager could provide input regarding which types of steel worked best in
which presses. The warehouse foreman gave inputs regarding how long various types of steel
could be held in inventory before rust spots began to form on their surfaces. Each person
contributed the necessary information to help Richard in making his decision.
19) The demand for Alpha Stampings' products is ultimately based on the demand for new
automobiles in the consumer market. This is an example of ________ demand.
A) negative
B) latent
C) primary
D) derived
E) composite

Answer: The total demand for many business products is not much affected by price changes,

demand for shoes.

32) Distinguish between business markets and consumer markets.
Answer: As compared to consumer markets, business markets usually have fewer but larger
buyers. Business demand is derived demand, which tends to be more inelastic and fluctuating
than consumer demand. The business buying decision usually involves more, and more
professional, buyers. Business buyers usually face more complex buying decisions, and the
buying process tends to be more formalized. Finally, business buyers and sellers are often more
dependent on each other.

opportunity to make a better offer and gain new business.

91) Why is it difficult to assess interpersonal factors that influence the business buying process?
Answer: Interpersonal factors such as who is liked, who controls rewards and punishments, and
who has special relationships with other important participants are often very subtle and not
obvious to the external observer. Therefore, a business marketer is likely to find it difficult to
assess interpersonal factors in the business buying process.

92) Describe the major types of buying situations.
Answer: There are three major types of buying situations.
In a straight rebuy, the buyer reorders something without any modifications. It is usually
handled on a routine basis by the purchasing department. To keep the business, "in" suppliers
try to maintain product and service quality. "Out" suppliers try to find new ways to add value or
exploit dissatisfaction so that the buyer will consider them.
In a modified rebuy, the buyer wants to modify product specifications, prices, terms, or
suppliers. The "in" suppliers may become nervous and feel pressured to put their best foot
forward to protect an account. "Out" suppliers may see the modified rebuy situation as an
opportunity to make a better offer and gain new business.
A company buying a product or service for the first time faces a new task situation. In such
cases, the greater the cost or risk, the larger the number of decision participants and the greater
the company's efforts to collect information. The new task situation is the marketer's greatest
opportunity and challenge. The marketer not only tries to reach as many key buying influences
as possible but also provides help and information. The buyer makes the fewest decisions in the
straight rebuy and the most in the new task decision.

93) Explain the advantages of systems selling.
Answer: Many business buyers prefer to buy a complete solution to a problem from a single
seller rather than buying separate products and services from several suppliers and putting them
together. The sale often goes to the firm that provides the most complete system for meeting the
customer's needs and solving its problems. Such systems selling (or solutions selling) is often a
key business marketing strategy for winning and holding accounts.

94) Define a buying center and the major roles played by members of an organization in the
purchase decision process.
Answer: The decision-making unit of a buying organization is called its buying center. It
consists of all the individuals and units that play a role in the business purchase decision-
making process. This group includes the actual users of the product or service, those who make
the buying decision, those who influence the buying decision, those who do the actual buying,
and those who control buying information. The buying center includes all members of the
organization who play any of five roles in the purchase decision process:
1. Users are members of the organization who will use the product or service. In many cases,
users initiate the buying proposal and help define product specifications.
2. Influencers often help define specifications and also provide information for evaluating
alternatives. Technical personnel are particularly important influencers.
3. Buyers have formal authority to select the supplier and arrange terms of purchase. Buyers
may help shape product specifications, but their major role is in selecting vendors and
negotiating. In more complex purchases, buyers might include high-level officers participating
in the negotiations.
4. Deciders have formal or informal power to select or approve the final suppliers. In routine
buying, the buyers are often the deciders, or at least the approvers.
5. Gatekeepers control the flow of information to others. For example, purchasing agents often
have authority to prevent salespersons from seeing users or deciders. Other gatekeepers include
technical personnel and even personal secretaries.

95) "The buying center concept presents a major marketing challenge." What does a business
marketer need to learn in order to deal with the challenge effectively?
Answer: The buying center is not a fixed and formally identified unit within the buying
organization. It is a set of buying roles assumed by different people for different purchases.
Within the organization, the size and makeup of the buying center will vary for different
products and for different buying situations. The buying center concept presents a major
marketing challenge. The business marketer must learn who participates in the decision, each
participant's relative influence, and what evaluation criteria each decision participant uses.

96) Discuss the major influences on business buyers.
Answer: Business buyers are heavily influenced by factors in the current and expected
economic environment, such as the level of primary demand, the economic outlook, and the
cost of money. Another environmental factor is the supply of key materials. Many companies
now are more willing to buy and hold larger inventories of scarce materials to ensure adequate
supply. Business buyers also are affected by technological, political, and competitive
developments in the environment. Finally, culture and customs can strongly influence business
buyer reactions to the marketer's behavior and strategies, especially in the international
marketing environment. Organizational factors are also important. Each buying organization
has its own objectives, strategies, structure, systems, and procedures, and the business marketer
must understand these factors well. The buying center usually includes many participants who
influence each other, so interpersonal factors also influence the business buying process.
However, it is often difficult to assess such interpersonal factors and group dynamics.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Alpha Stampings Inc. produces 14 metal stampings for the automotive industry. Due to industry
design changes and consumer demands, for the next financial year, six of those stampings will
require a slight change: two will have an extra hole punched through the side, two will require
an extra plating process, and two will require an additional weld operation.
In the meantime, purchasing agent Richard Koehl has been asked to reduce the number of
Alpha's steel suppliers in an effort to cut costs. After obtaining updated price quotations and
steel samples from his current suppliers, Richard faced a dilemma. Until now, he had selected
his suppliers based on quality and price, but the major consideration had been the type of steel
required and the specialized production processes of his respective suppliers. Not all of Alpha's
suppliers could produce the exact grades of steel needed; some suppliers were better at
producing certain types of steel than others.
Richard contacted several employees at Alpha who had worked with the various types of steel
in the past. The quality control manager and line inspector, for example, could help to
determine which suppliers had the capabilities of producing specific types of steel. The
production control manager could provide input regarding which types of steel worked best in
which presses. The warehouse foreman gave inputs regarding how long various types of steel
could be held in inventory before rust spots began to form on their surfaces. Each person
contributed the necessary information to help Richard in making his decision.

138) Briefly describe the eight steps in the business buying process.
Answer: The eight steps in the business buying process are: problem recognition, general
needs description, product specification, supplier search, proposal solicitation, supplier
selection, order-routine specification, and performance review.
1. Problem recognition: The buying process begins when someone in the company recognizes a
problem or need that can be met by acquiring a specific product or service. Problem recognition
can result from internal or external stimuli.
2. General needs description: Having recognized a need, the buyer next prepares a general need
description that describes the characteristics and quantity of the needed item. For standard
items, this process presents few problems. For complex items, however, the buyer may need to
work with others—engineers, users, and consultants—to define the item.
3. Product specifications: The buying organization next develops the item's technical product
specifications, often with the help of a value analysis engineering team. Product value analysis
is an approach to cost reduction in which components are studied carefully to determine if they
can be redesigned, standardized, or made by less costly methods of production.
4. Supplier search: The buyer now conducts a supplier search to find the best vendors. The
buyer can compile a small list of qualified suppliers by reviewing trade directories, doing
computer searches, or contacting other companies for recommendations.
5. Proposal solicitation: In the proposal solicitation stage of the business buying process, the
buyer invites qualified suppliers to submit proposals. In response, some suppliers will refer the
buyer to their Web sites or promotional materials or send a salesperson to call on the prospect.
However, when the item is complex or expensive, the buyer will usually require detailed
written proposals or formal presentations from each potential supplier.
6. Supplier selection: During supplier selection, the buying center often will draw up a list of
the desired supplier attributes and their relative importance. Such attributes include product and
service quality, reputation, on-time delivery, ethical corporate behavior, honest communication,
and competitive prices.
7. Order-routine specification: The buyer now prepares an order-routine specification. It
includes the final order with the chosen supplier or suppliers and lists items such as technical
specifications, quantity needed, expected delivery time, return policies, and warranties.
8. Performance review: In this stage, the buyer reviews supplier performance. The buyer may
contact users and ask them to rate their satisfaction. The performance review may lead the
buyer to continue, modify, or drop the arrangement. The seller's job is to monitor the same
factors used by the buyer to make sure that the seller is giving the expected satisfaction.

153) What is e-procurement? Briefly describe its major advantages.
Answer: E-procurement refers to purchasing through electronic connections between buyers
and sellers—usually online.
E-procurement gives buyers access to new suppliers, lowers purchasing costs, and hastens
order processing and delivery. In turn, business marketers can connect with customers online to
share marketing information, sell products and services, provide customer support services, and
maintain ongoing customer relationships. E-procurement frees purchasing people from a lot of
drudgery and paperwork. In turn, it frees them to focus on more strategic issues, such as finding
better supply sources and working with suppliers to reduce costs and develop new products.

Answer: The government market offers large opportunities for many companies, both big and

Government organizations typically require suppliers to submit bids, and normally they award
the contract to the lowest bidder. In some cases, a governmental unit will make allowances for
the supplier's superior quality or reputation for completing contracts on time. Governments will
also buy on a negotiated contract basis, primarily in the case of complex projects involving
major research and development (R&D) costs and risks, and in cases where there is little
competition. Government organizations tend to favor domestic suppliers over foreign suppliers.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Ruben Delgado was making wooden pens and pencils, which had unique engravings, as a
hobby until Simon Yoder recognized Ruben's talent. Simon immediately ordered 250 pens and
pencils of various styles to be displayed in his shop's showcase. Within three months, the
wooden pencils were a hit with all students! Ruben Delgado had never thought of marketing his
talent, but Simon's enthusiasm and the recent sales were enough to change his mind.
With limited resources, Ruben contacted three additional specialty shops within 100 miles that
were situated near schools. He explained his manufacturing processes and engraving options to
each. All three shop owners placed a trial order. Within two months, just prior to the holiday
season, each shop owner placed an additional order. Ruben was ecstatic! "I figured business
would slow down after that," Ruben stated, "but in February I was contacted by Elmore
Distributors. At that point, I had to make a huge decision about how far I wanted to go with this
business."
Elmore Distributors provides products for school fundraisers in a seven-state area. Ruben was
offered a two-year contract and immediate inclusion in Elmore's promotional flyer. Ruben
Delgado accepted the offer and, along with it, the responsibility to produce thousands of
wooden pens and pencils. "I had to get a grip on the magnitude of this project," Ruben added.
He decided to place his major focus on the large contract with Elmore. However, to avoid
placing his total emphasis with one customer, Ruben continued nurturing his four previously
established accounts without targeting any additional customers.
"At this point, I had set up an assembly line in a rented building," Ruben explained. "I had to
hire three full-time employees to work the line while I managed the customer orders and
purchased materials." Ruben paused. "But I can't take the Elmore project for granted. It might
not always be there. I'll have to have a good alternate plan if that day comes."
62) In the scenario, Ruben has segmented his market based on ________.
A) geography
B) benefits sought
C) occasion
D) degree of loyalty
E) demographics

Answer: One reason is that consumer needs, wants, and usage rates often vary closely with

other types of variables. Even when marketers first define segments using other bases, such as
benefits sought or behavior, they must know a segment's demographic characteristics to assess
the size of the target market and reach it efficiently.

can detect which brands are most competitive with its own. By looking at customers who are
shifting away from its brand, the company can learn about its marketing weaknesses and take
actions to correct them.

Companies often begin by segmenting their markets using a single base, and then expand using
other bases.

3. Substantial: The market segments are large or profitable enough to serve. A segment should

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Ruben Delgado was making wooden pens and pencils, which had unique engravings, as a
hobby until Simon Yoder recognized Ruben's talent. Simon immediately ordered 250 pens and
pencils of various styles to be displayed in his shop's showcase. Within three months, the
wooden pencils were a hit with all students! Ruben Delgado had never thought of marketing his
talent, but Simon's enthusiasm and the recent sales were enough to change his mind.
With limited resources, Ruben contacted three additional specialty shops within 100 miles that
were situated near schools. He explained his manufacturing processes and engraving options to
each. All three shop owners placed a trial order. Within two months, just prior to the holiday
season, each shop owner placed an additional order. Ruben was ecstatic! "I figured business
would slow down after that," Ruben stated, "but in February I was contacted by Elmore
Distributors. At that point, I had to make a huge decision about how far I wanted to go with this
business."
Elmore Distributors provides products for school fundraisers in a seven-state area. Ruben was
offered a two-year contract and immediate inclusion in Elmore's promotional flyer. Ruben
Delgado accepted the offer and, along with it, the responsibility to produce thousands of
wooden pens and pencils. "I had to get a grip on the magnitude of this project," Ruben added.
He decided to place his major focus on the large contract with Elmore. However, to avoid
placing his total emphasis with one customer, Ruben continued nurturing his four previously
established accounts without targeting any additional customers.
"At this point, I had set up an assembly line in a rented building," Ruben explained. "I had to
hire three full-time employees to work the line while I managed the customer orders and
purchased materials." Ruben paused. "But I can't take the Elmore project for granted. It might
not always be there. I'll have to have a good alternate plan if that day comes."
114) In marketing his wooden pens and pencils to specialty-shop customers, Ruben was most
likely using ________ marketing.
A) mass
B) trigger-based
C) concentrated

131) How do companies identify attractive market segments? How do they choose a target
marketing strategy?
Answer: To target the best market segments, the company first evaluates each segment's size
and growth characteristics, structural attractiveness, and compatibility with company objectives
and resources. It then chooses one of four marketing strategies: undifferentiated, differentiated,
concentrated, and micromarketing. The seller can ignore segment differences and target broadly
using undifferentiated marketing. This involves mass-producing, mass-distributing, and mass-
promoting nearly the same product in about the same way to all consumers. Or the seller can
adopt differentiated marketing by developing different market offers for several segments.
Concentrated marketing involves focusing on only one or a few market segments. Finally,
micromarketing is the practice of tailoring products and marketing programs to suit the tastes of
specific individuals and locations.
The targeting strategy depends on the company resources, product variability, product life-cycle
stage, market variability, and competitive marketing strategies.

133) Briefly explain local and individual marketing.
Answer: Local marketing involves tailoring brands and promotions to the needs and wants of
local customer groups—cities, neighborhoods, and even specific stores. Advances in
communications technology have given rise to new high-tech versions of location-based
marketing. Increasingly, location-based marketing is going mobile, reaching on-the-go
consumers as they come and go in key local market areas.
In the extreme, micromarketing becomes individual marketing—tailoring products and
marketing programs to the needs and preferences of individual customers. Individual marketing
has also been labeled one-to-one marketing, mass customization, and markets-of-one
marketing. More detailed databases, robotic production and flexible manufacturing, and
interactive media such as mobile phones and the Internet have combined to foster mass
customization.

Answer: A product position is the way a product is defined by consumers on important
attributes—the place the product occupies in consumers' minds relative to competing products.
Products are made in factories, but brands happen in the minds of consumers. Consumers
position products with or without the help of marketers. But marketers do not want to leave
their products' positions to chance. They must plan positions that will give their products the
greatest advantage in selected target markets, and they must design marketing mixes to create
these planned positions.
In planning their differentiation and positioning strategies, marketers often prepare perceptual
positioning maps that show consumer perceptions of their brands versus competing products on
important buying dimensions.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Ruben Delgado built his enterprise on the faithful patronage of four specialty shops and a large
contract from Elmore Distributors. But after two years, the maker of novelty pens and pencils
had to rethink his strategy when his contract with Elmore ended.
Ruben built a company reputation on the manufacturing and distribution of a variety of wooden
writing utensils with customized engravings. Specialty shops loved to display the products in
their fancy, lighted showcases, but such specialty shops alone were not profitable. Ruben
Delgado established a brand name, known merely as Delgado, and decided to expand on it.
Ruben extended his writing utensil lines to include quills, felt-tip pens, and multiple-cartridge
pens that write in different colors. He even added a line of various grades of personalized
stationery and business cards. Perhaps Ruben's biggest added touch, however, was the addition
of two salespeople who would work to explain the diverse array of products offered by
Delgado, as well as nurture existing accounts.
"We make an excellent product," Ruben Delgado stated, "and we honor a good guarantee on
everything we sell. But let's face it—we face hundreds of competitors! We need Delgado
representatives out there to help prospects understand what they should demand in something
as simple as a writing tool." The Delgado brand was fast-becoming synonymous with top-notch
customer service. Part of the purchase package brought personal visits from the Delgado
representative, before the purchase and long after.
42) An easier, more comfortable, more stylish transfer of thought onto paper refers to the
________ of Ruben's offerings.
A) tangible element
B) core customer value
C) actual product
D) augmented product

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Ruben Delgado built his enterprise on the faithful patronage of four specialty shops and a large
contract from Elmore Distributors. But after two years, the maker of novelty pens and pencils
had to rethink his strategy when his contract with Elmore ended.
Ruben built a company reputation on the manufacturing and distribution of a variety of wooden
writing utensils with customized engravings. Specialty shops loved to display the products in
their fancy, lighted showcases, but such specialty shops alone were not profitable. Ruben
Delgado established a brand name, known merely as Delgado, and decided to expand on it.
Ruben extended his writing utensil lines to include quills, felt-tip pens, and multiple-cartridge
pens that write in different colors. He even added a line of various grades of personalized
stationery and business cards. Perhaps Ruben's biggest added touch, however, was the addition
of two salespeople who would work to explain the diverse array of products offered by
Delgado, as well as nurture existing accounts.
"We make an excellent product," Ruben Delgado stated, "and we honor a good guarantee on
everything we sell. But let's face it—we face hundreds of competitors! We need Delgado
representatives out there to help prospects understand what they should demand in something
as simple as a writing tool." The Delgado brand was fast-becoming synonymous with top-notch
customer service. Part of the purchase package brought personal visits from the Delgado
representative, before the purchase and long after.
87) The new felt-tip pens, multiple-cartridge pens, and quills offered by Ruben Delgado are
examples of ________.
A) product line filling
B) multibranding
C) megabranding
D) product line inconsistencies
E) co-branding

Traditionally, the primary function of the package was to hold and protect the product. In recent
times, however, packaging has become an important marketing tool as well. Increased
competition and clutter on retail store shelves means that packages must now perform many
sales tasks—from attracting buyers, to communicating brand positioning, to closing the sale.

104) Briefly describe the history of legal concerns about packaging and labels.
Answer: The Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 held that false, misleading, or deceptive
labels or packages constitute unfair competition. Labels can mislead consumers, fail to describe
important ingredients, or fail to include needed safety warnings. As a result, several federal and
state laws regulate labeling. The most prominent is the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act of
1966, which set mandatory labeling requirements, encouraged voluntary industry packaging
standards, and allowed federal agencies to set packaging regulations in specific industries. The
Nutritional Labeling and Educational Act of 1990 requires sellers to provide detailed nutritional
information on food products, and recent sweeping actions by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) regulate the use of health-related terms such as low fat, light, high fiber,
and organic.

often depends little on how the product is obtained. But in services marketing, service quality
depends on both the service deliverer and the quality of delivery. Service marketers, therefore,
have to master interactive marketing skills.

service employees, greater service value, satisfied and loyal customers, and healthy service
profits and growth.
On the other hand, internal marketing means that the service firm must orient and motivate its
customer-contact employees and supporting service people to work as a team to provide
customer satisfaction. Marketers must get everyone in the organization to be customer centered.
In fact, internal marketing must precede external marketing.

able and reliable customer-contact people, developing a superior physical environment in which
the service product is delivered, or designing a superior delivery process. Services can also be
differentiated through symbols and branding, by creating an image that sets a company's
services apart from that of its competitors.

Answer: Brand equity is the differential effect that knowing the brand name has on customer
response to the product and its marketing. It's a measure of the brand's ability to capture
consumer preference and loyalty. A brand has positive brand equity when consumers react more
favorably to it than to a generic or unbranded version of the same product. It has negative brand
equity if consumers react less favorably than to an unbranded version.

market licensed brands. Finally, two companies can join forces and co-brand a product.

extension extends a current brand name to a new or modified product in a new product

company may decide that a new brand name is needed, particularly if the power of an existing
brand name is declining or the company is entering a new product category.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Most people laughed when Evelyn Ringler explained her product idea: a solar-powered vacuum
cleaner. But the concept was practical and the technology used in the vacuum was the same as
that used in many electronic toys. After setting up a demonstration booth in a mall in a Chicago
suburb, Evelyn felt more assured than ever that her idea would be a hit. Consumers seemed
receptive and offered helpful pieces of advice, such as how much they would pay for the
vacuum, what colors they would prefer, and why they would not buy the vacuum.
The vacuum itself was shaped like a small saucer, with a filter bag on top and sensory nodes
along the edges. After being charged in the sunlight, the vacuum could run for 7 hours,
covering a floor area of 600 square feet. As the apparatus lightly bumped into table legs, chairs,
and so on, the sensory nodes allowed the vacuum to move around the objects in various
directions. This is the same type of technology used in the manufacture of children's racecars
and walking dolls.
Evelyn knew that the solar-powered vacuum would be especially helpful to both elderly
consumers, who may have a more difficult time with vacuuming, and on-the-go consumers who
lead busy lives. The price would be above average but would likely be reduced after Evelyn
recouped some of her costs.
After a 500-unit production run and a substantial financial investment, Evelyn set up a
multiple-city test market, in a Chicago mall and in an appliance store in New Jersey and several
other retail stores in Florida. "It's such a novel idea," Evelyn added. "People will notice it, even
if they don't buy it right away."
74) Evelyn's ________ is the practical use of solar power in a vacuum cleaner that is designed
to effortlessly vacuum clean the floors of on-the-go and elderly consumers.
A) product placement
B) product concept
C) product image
D) product idea

100) Briefly describe the steps in the new product development process.
Answer: New product development starts with idea generation from internal and/or external
sources. Next, the ideas must be reduced through idea screening. Once the new ideas are
decided upon, the product concept must be developed and tested. A marketing strategy must be
developed to introduce the product to the market. Once the product concept and marketing
strategy are chosen, a business analysis is conducted to review the sales, costs, and profit
projections to see if they will satisfy the company's objectives. Next, a prototype will be created
in the product development stage. Test marketing will follow, introducing the new product and
its marketing program into more realistic market settings. The last step is to launch or not
launch the new product. If the company decides to launch the product, it will go ahead with the
commercialization stage and later test its sales and profit results.

103) Explain concept testing.
Answer: Concept testing calls for testing new product concepts with groups of target
consumers. The concepts may be presented to consumers physically or symbolically. A more
concrete and physical presentation, however, will increase the reliability of the concept test.
After being exposed to the concept, consumers are asked questions about it; their answers
reveal to the marketer whether the concept needs to be altered in any way.

Answer: Introducing a new product into the market is called commercialization. The company
launching a new product must first decide on introduction timing. Next, the company must
decide where to launch the new product—in a single location, a region, the national market, or
the international market. Confidence, capital, and capacity are required to launch new products
on a large-scale basis. Hence, many firms plan a market rollout over time.

105) What are the two advantages of an innovation management system for developing new
products? Provide four strategies for a company to use to establish a successful system.
Answer: The first advantage of an innovation management system is that it helps create an
innovation-oriented company culture. It shows that top management supports, encourages, and
rewards innovation. The second advantage is that it will yield a larger number of new product
ideas, among which will be found some especially good ones. As the system matures, ideas will
flow more freely.
To establish a successful system a company can do the following:
1. Appoint a respected senior person to be the company's innovation manager.
2. Create a cross-functional innovation management committee with people from each
department.
3. Set up a Web site for anyone who wants to become involved in finding and developing new
products.
4. Encourage all company stakeholders to send their ideas to the idea manager.
5. Set up formal recognition programs to reward those who contribute the best new ideas.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Most people laughed when Evelyn Ringler explained her product idea: a solar-powered vacuum
cleaner. But the concept was practical and the technology used in the vacuum was the same as
that used in many electronic toys. After setting up a demonstration booth in a mall in a Chicago
suburb, Evelyn felt more assured than ever that her idea would be a hit. Consumers seemed
receptive and offered helpful pieces of advice, such as how much they would pay for the
vacuum, what colors they would prefer, and why they would not buy the vacuum.
The vacuum itself was shaped like a small saucer, with a filter bag on top and sensory nodes
along the edges. After being charged in the sunlight, the vacuum could run for 7 hours,
covering a floor area of 600 square feet. As the apparatus lightly bumped into table legs, chairs,
and so on, the sensory nodes allowed the vacuum to move around the objects in various
directions. This is the same type of technology used in the manufacture of children's racecars
and walking dolls.
Evelyn knew that the solar-powered vacuum would be especially helpful to both elderly
consumers, who may have a more difficult time with vacuuming, and on-the-go consumers who
lead busy lives. The price would be above average but would likely be reduced after Evelyn
recouped some of her costs.
After a 500-unit production run and a substantial financial investment, Evelyn set up a
multiple-city test market, in a Chicago mall and in an appliance store in New Jersey and several
other retail stores in Florida. "It's such a novel idea," Evelyn added. "People will notice it, even
if they don't buy it right away."
135) Evelyn's vacuum is at the ________ stage of the product life cycle.
A) product development
B) introduction
C) growth
D) decline
E) maturity

Answer:
-Product development begins when the company finds and develops a new product idea. Sales
are zero and the company's investment costs mount.
-Introduction is a period of slow sales growth as the product is introduced in the market. Profits
are nonexistent in this stage because of the heavy expenses of product introduction.
-Growth is a period of rapid market acceptance and increasing profits.
-Maturity is a period of slowdown in sales growth because the product has achieved acceptance
by most potential buyers. Profits level off or decline because of increased marketing outlays to
defend the product against competition.
-Decline is the period when sales fall off and profits drop. A company may seek to reinvigorate
a product in decline or maintain it hoping competition will diminish or harvest it or drop it.

as they make decisions about adding or dropping products.
Answer: The government may prevent companies from adding products through acquisitions if
the effect threatens to lessen competition. On the other hand, companies dropping products
must be aware that they have legal obligations to their suppliers, dealers, and customers who
have a stake in the dropped product. Companies must also obey U.S. patent laws when
developing new products, meaning that a company cannot make its product illegally similar to
another company's established product. Manufacturers must also comply with specific laws
regarding product quality and safety. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the
Consumer Product Safety Act are just two of many laws that protect consumers from
potentially harmful products. If consumers have been injured by a product that has a defective
design, they can sue manufacturers or dealers.

9) Define price. Discuss its importance.
Answer: In the narrowest sense, price is the amount of money charged for a product or a
service. More broadly, price is the sum of all the values that customers give up to gain the
benefits of having or using a product or service. Historically, price has been the major factor
affecting buyer choice. In recent decades, however, nonprice factors have gained increasing
importance. Even so, price remains one of the most important elements that determines a firm's
market share and profitability.
Price is the only element in the marketing mix that produces revenue; all other elements
represent costs. Price is also one of the most flexible marketing mix elements. Unlike product
features and channel commitments, prices can be changed quickly. At the same time, pricing is
the number one problem facing many marketing executives, and many companies do not
handle pricing well. Some managers view pricing as a big headache, preferring instead to focus
on other marketing mix elements. However, smart managers treat pricing as a key strategic tool
for creating and capturing customer value. Prices have a direct impact on a firm's bottom line. A
small percentage improvement in price can generate a large percentage increase in profitability.
More important, as part of a company's overall value proposition, price plays a key role in
creating customer value and building customer relationships.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Alden Manufacturing produces small kitchen appliances—blenders, hand mixers, and electric
skillets—under the brand name First Generation. Alden attempts to target newlyweds and first-
time home buyers with this brand.
Considering that most young households have limited financial resources, Alden attempts to
engage in target costing. "In doing this," says Milt Alden, the co-founder of Alden Electronics,
"we have better control over keeping price right in line with customers."
Alden manufactures a three-speed blender, its top seller, along with a five-speed blender. The
hand mixers are manufactured in two variants—a small handheld mixer with two rotating
beaters and another that comes with an optional stand and an attached mixing bowl. Alden's
temperature-controlled skillets are manufactured in a single style with three color options.
"Our product offerings are narrower," Milt Alden added, "but our line workers know each
product like the back of their hands. This allows us to produce superior products while holding
our prices low.
77) Milt Alden says that his line workers "know each product like the back of their hands," and
that this knowledge helps the company keep its prices low. This indicates that Alden
Manufacturing most likely benefits from the ________.
A) cost-plus pricing
B) value-added pricing
C) experience curve
D) inelastic demand in the market
E) derived demand in the market

begins with analyzing consumer needs and value perceptions, and the price is set to match
perceived value.

108) Distinguish between value-based pricing and cost-based pricing.
Answer: Customer value-based pricing uses buyers' perceptions of value as the key to pricing.
Value-based pricing means that the marketer cannot design a product and marketing program
and then set the price. Price is considered along with all other marketing mix variables before
the marketing program is set.
Although costs are an important consideration in setting prices, cost-based pricing is often
product driven. The company designs what it considers to be a good product, adds up the costs
of making the product, and sets a price that covers costs plus a target profit. Marketing must
then convince buyers that the product's value at that price justifies its purchase.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Alden Manufacturing produces small kitchen appliances—blenders, hand mixers, and electric
skillets—under the brand name First Generation. Alden attempts to target newlyweds and first-
time home buyers with this brand.
Considering that most young households have limited financial resources, Alden attempts to
engage in target costing. "In doing this," says Milt Alden, the co-founder of Alden Electronics,
"we have better control over keeping price right in line with customers."
Alden manufactures a three-speed blender, its top seller, along with a five-speed blender. The
hand mixers are manufactured in two variants—a small handheld mixer with two rotating
beaters and another that comes with an optional stand and an attached mixing bowl. Alden's
temperature-controlled skillets are manufactured in a single style with three color options.
"Our product offerings are narrower," Milt Alden added, "but our line workers know each
product like the back of their hands. This allows us to produce superior products while holding
our prices low.
143) Milt Alden uses which of the following strategies for pricing his products?
A) basing company price on competitors' prices
B) using everyday low pricing
C) initiating an aggressive promotional campaign
D) starting with customer-value considerations
E) focusing on overall fixed costs of manufacturing

156) What are the different internal factors that affect a firm's pricing decisions?
Answer: Beyond customer value perceptions, costs, and competitor strategies, the company
must consider several additional internal and external factors. Internal factors affecting pricing
include the company's overall marketing strategy, objectives, and marketing mix, as well as
other organizational considerations. Price is only one element of the company's broader
marketing strategy. If the company has selected its target market and positioning carefully, then
its marketing mix strategy, including price, will be fairly straightforward. Some companies
position their products on price and then tailor other marketing mix decisions to the prices they
want to charge. Other companies deemphasize price and use other marketing mix tools to create
nonprice positions.

157) Compare and contrast pure competition and oligopolistic competition.
Answer: Under pure competition, the market consists of many buyers and sellers trading in a
uniform commodity, such as wheat, copper, or financial securities. No single buyer or seller has
much effect on the going market price. In a purely competitive market, marketing research,
product development, pricing, advertising, and sales promotion play little or no role. Thus,
sellers in these markets do not spend much time on marketing strategy.
On the other hand, under oligopolistic competition, the market consists of only a few large
sellers. Because there are few sellers, each seller is alert and responsive to competitors' pricing
strategies and marketing moves.

158) Briefly discuss monopolistic competition.
Answer: Under monopolistic competition, the market consists of many buyers and sellers who
trade over a range of prices rather than a single market price. A range of prices occurs because
sellers can differentiate their offers to buyers. Because there are many competitors, each firm is
less affected by competitors' pricing strategies than in oligopolistic markets. Sellers try to
develop differentiated offers for different customer segments and, in addition to price, freely
use branding, advertising, and personal selling to set their offers apart.

159) What is a demand curve? Explain its importance in the context of pricing decisions.
Answer: A demand curve shows the number of units the market will buy in a given time
period, at different prices that might be charged. Each price the company might charge will lead
to a different level of demand. The relationship between the price charged and the resulting
demand level is shown in the demand curve. In the normal case, demand and price are inversely
related—that is, the higher the price, the lower the demand. Thus, the company would sell less
if it raised its price from P1 to P2. In short, consumers with limited budgets probably will buy
less of something if its price is too high. Understanding a brand's price-demand curve is crucial
to good pricing decisions. Most companies try to measure their demand curves by estimating
demand at different prices. The type of market makes a difference. In a monopoly, the demand
curve shows the total market demand resulting from different prices. If the company faces
competition, its demand at different prices will depend on whether competitors' prices stay
constant or change with the company's own prices.

160) Explain price elasticity. What determines the elasticity of demand?
50
Answer: Price elasticity refers to a measure of the sensitivity of demand to changes in price. If
demand hardly changes with a small change in price, the demand is inelastic. If demand
changes greatly, it is elastic.
If demand is elastic rather than inelastic, sellers will consider lowering their prices. A lower
price will produce more total revenue. This practice makes sense as long as the extra costs of
producing and selling more do not exceed the extra revenue. At the same time, most firms want
to avoid pricing that turns their products into commodities. In recent years, forces such as
deregulation and the instant price comparisons afforded by the Internet and other technologies
have increased consumer price sensitivity, turning products ranging from telephones and
computers to new automobiles into commodities in some consumers' eyes.

161) Briefly describe how economic conditions impact a firm's pricing strategies.
Answer: Economic conditions can have a strong impact on a firm's pricing strategies.
Economic factors such as a boom or recession, inflation, and interest rates affect pricing
decisions because they affect consumer spending, consumer perceptions of the product's price
and value, and the company's costs of producing and selling a product.
In the aftermath of the recent Great Recession of 2008 to 2009, many consumers have
rethought the price-value equation. They have tightened their belts and become more value
conscious. Consumers will likely continue their thriftier ways well beyond any economic
recovery. As a result, many marketers have increased their emphasis on value-for-the-money
pricing strategies.
The most obvious response to the new economic realities is to cut prices and offer discounts.
Thousands of companies have done just that. Lower prices make products more affordable and
help spur short-term sales. However, such price cuts can have undesirable long-term
consequences. Lower prices mean lower margins. Deep discounts may cheapen a brand in
consumers' eyes. And once a company cuts prices, it is difficult to raise them again when the
economy recovers.

162) "Beyond the market and the economy, the company must consider several other factors in
its external environment when setting prices." Explain this statement.
Answer: Beyond the market and the economy, the company must consider several other factors
in its external environment when setting prices. It must know what impact its prices will have
on other parties in its environment. How will resellers react to various prices? The company
should set prices that give resellers a fair profit, encourage their support, and help them to sell
the product effectively. The government is another important external influence on pricing
decisions. Finally, social concerns may need to be taken into account. In setting prices, a
company's short-term sales, market share, and profit goals may need to be tempered by broader
societal considerations.

the market with high initial prices. The product's quality and image must support its higher
price, and enough buyers must want the product at that price. The costs of producing a smaller
volume cannot be so high that they cancel the advantage of charging more. Competitors should
not be able to enter the market easily and undercut the high price. Market penetration is used to
penetrate the market quickly and deeply to attract a large number of buyers quickly and win a
large market share by setting a low price initially when it enters the market. The market must be
highly price sensitive so that a low price produces more market growth. Production and
distribution costs must fall as sales volume increases. Also, the low price must help keep out
competition and be maintained over time.

120) Differentiate between dynamic and fixed pricing.
Answer: Throughout most of history, prices were set by negotiation between buyers and
sellers. The fixed price policy—setting one price for all buyers—is a relatively modern idea
that arose with the development of large-scale retailing at the end of the nineteenth century.
Today most prices are set this way. However, some companies are now reversing the fixed
pricing trend. They are using dynamic pricing, adjusting prices continually to meet the
characteristics and needs of individual customers and situations. Dynamic pricing makes sense
in many contexts. It adjusts prices according to market forces, and it often works to the benefit
of the customer.

121) Explain the factors involved in setting international pricing.
Answer: In some cases, a company can set a uniform worldwide price. However, most
companies adjust their prices to reflect local market conditions and cost considerations. A firm
must consider economic conditions, competitive situations, laws and regulations, and
development of the wholesale and retail system. Consumer perceptions and preferences also
may vary from country to country, calling for different prices. The company may have different
marketing objectives in various world markets. Costs play an important role in setting
international prices. Management must prepare for price escalation that may result from the
differences in selling strategies or market conditions. The additional costs of operations,
product modifications, shipping and insurance, import tariffs and taxes, exchange-rate
fluctuations, and physical distribution must all be factored into the "price."

141) Discuss the conditions under which a company might consider using price cuts or price
increases.
Answer: Price cuts may be necessary when there is excess capacity. Another time to cut prices
is when market share is falling in the face of strong price competition. A company may also cut
prices in a drive to dominate the market through lower costs. A major factor in price increases
is cost inflation. Rising costs squeeze profit margins and lead companies to pass cost increases
along to customers. Another factor leading to price increases is over-demand. When a company
cannot supply all its customers' needs, it can raise its prices, ration products to customers, or
both.

likely reactions of its competitors?
Answer: Competitors are most likely to react when the number of firms involved is small,
when the product is uniform, and when the buyers are well informed. If the firm faces one large
competitor, and if the competitor tends to react in a set way to price changes, that reaction can
be easily anticipated. But if the competitor treats each price change as a fresh challenge and
reacts according to its self-interest, the company will have to figure out just what makes up the
competitor's self-interest at the time.

to regulate business practices that might unfairly restrain trade. Because these statutes can be
applied only to interstate commerce, many states have adopted similar provisions for
companies that operate locally. Examples include pricing within channel levels and pricing
across channel levels.

165) Compare the practices of price fixing and predatory pricing. Explain why each is
prohibited by law.
Answer: Many federal, state, and local laws govern the rules of fair play in pricing. Two major
areas of concern are price fixing and predatory pricing. Companies that engage in price fixing
collude to set a common price for their comparable products; price fixing undermines the core
element of price competition in our free-market economy. On the other hand, predatory pricing
takes price competition too far. Predatory pricing occurs when a company sells a product below
cost with the intention of punishing a competitor or by putting a competitor out of business.

36) Why is the term value delivery network a more relevant expression to use than the terms
supply chain or demand chain?
Answer: The term supply chain may be too limited, because it takes a make-and-sell view of
the business. It suggests that raw materials, productive inputs, and factory capacity should serve
as the starting point for market planning. The term demand chain is better because it suggests a
sense-and-respond view of the market. Under this view, planning starts by identifying the needs
of target customers, to which the company responds by organizing a chain of resources and
activities with the goal of creating customer value. However, even a demand chain view of a
business may be too limited because it takes a step-by-step, linear view of purchase-production-
consumption activities. Most large companies today are engaged in building and managing a
complex, continuously evolving value delivery network. A value delivery network is made up
of the company, suppliers, distributors, and, ultimately, customers who partner with each other
to improve the performance of the entire system.

Answer: Intermediaries reduce the amount of work that must be done by both producers and

wanted by consumers. They buy large quantities from many producers and break them down
into the smaller quantities and broader assortments wanted by consumers. Intermediaries help
to match supply and demand. Intermediaries add value by bridging the major time, place, and
possession gaps that separate goods and services from those who would use them.

Answer: A conventional distribution channel consists of one or more independent producers,
wholesalers, and retailers. Each is a separate business seeking to maximize its own profits, even
at the expense of the system as a whole. No channel member has much control over the other
members, and no formal means exists for assigning roles and resolving channel conflict. On the
other hand, a vertical marketing system is a unified system made up of producers, wholesalers,
and retailers. While members of a conventional distribution channel seek to maximize their
own profits, members of a vertical marketing system all cooperate because either one member
owns the others, one has contracts with the others, or one wields more power than the others.

Answer: Changes in technology and the growth of online marketing have increased
disintermediation, which is the cutting out of marketing channel intermediaries by product or
service producers, or the displacement of traditional intermediaries with radically new types. In
many industries, traditional intermediaries are dropping by the wayside. For example, many
airlines now sell directly to final buyers, cutting retailers and sales agents from their marketing
channels. Online marketers take business from traditional brick-and-mortar retailers.

127) Explain how companies select, motivate, and evaluate intermediaries or channel members.
Answer: When selecting intermediaries, the company should evaluate each channel member's
qualifications and select those who best fit its channel objectives. The company should use
economic criteria, control issues, and adaptive criteria to analyze each possible channel
member. Once selected, channel members must be continuously motivated to do their best. The
company must sell not only through the intermediaries but also to and with them. It should
work to forge long-term partnerships with channel partners to create a marketing system that
meets the needs of both the manufacturer and the partners. The company must also regularly
check channel member performance against established performance standards, rewarding
intermediaries who are performing well and assisting or replacing weaker ones.

Answer: For the most part, companies are legally free to develop whatever channel
arrangement suits them, as long as they do not substantially lessen competition or tend to create
a monopoly, and as long as both parties enter into the agreement voluntarily. Exclusive
territorial agreements in which a producer attempts to keep a dealer from selling outside of a
designated territory have become a major legal issue. Producers are free to select their dealers,
but they must have legitimate cause to terminate a relationship with a dealer.

Answer: A third-party logistics provider is an independent company that performs any or all of
50
the functions required to get a producer's product to market, helping clients to tighten up
sluggish, overstuffed supply chains, slash inventories, and get products to customers more
quickly and reliably. Companies use third-party logistics providers because getting the product
to market is the main focus of 3PLs, so they can often do it more efficiently and at a lower cost.
Second, outsourcing logistics frees a company to focus more intensely on its core business.
Finally, integrated logistics companies understand increasingly complex logistics environments.
For example, third-party logistics partners can be especially helpful to companies attempting to
expand their global market coverage.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
In the 1970s, Shipshewana was only a small town with a hardware store, a grain mill, a shoe
store, a small restaurant, and a grocery store. Over the next two decades, the small town
transformed into an international tourist attraction, attracting thousands of tourists who were
intrigued by the lifestyle of Shipshewana's largest population—the Amish.
Ben and Mary Miller, having grown up within the Amish faith, decided to capitalize on their
town's popularity and their woodworking skills. Their shop, Indiana Wood, began with a small
display of handmade hickory rocking chairs, Ben Miller's specialty. But within a few months,
the display at Indiana Wood included picnic tables, flower boxes, and small handmade novelty
items. No other shop offers the same variety.
Mary Miller decorated the shop's display room with authentic Amish décor and eventually
hired three Amish friends to sew and embroider napkins and other textiles as customers had
requested such items. In addition, two women from the Amish community sought permission
from the Millers to display home-baked pastries and jellies on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, when
Shipshewana attracts swarms of visitors to its flea market on the south edge of town. The
Millers also hired four more people to help customers throughout the purchasing process and to
provide the required product-related information to the customers.
"Shipshewana is full of specialty shops," Mary Miller stated. "People don't come here to buy
things made in China or Taiwan. They want real, Amish-made goods."

convenience goods. Examples include supermarkets, Target, and Kohl's. It can also include
limited-service retailers that provide more sales assistance because they carry more shopping
goods about which customers need information. Examples include Sears and JCPenney. The
third type is full-retailers that assist customers in every phase of the shopping process. These
stores usually carry more specialty goods for which customers need or want assistance or
advice. Examples include Nordstrom or Neiman Marcus.

72) Although many retail stores are independently owned, others band together under some
form of corporate or contractual organization. Describe the four kinds of corporate or
contractual organizations.
Answer:
-Corporate chains are two or more outlets that are commonly owned and controlled. Their size
allows them to buy in large quantities at lower prices and gain promotional economies. They
can hire specialists to deal with areas such as pricing, promotion, merchandising, inventory
control, and sales forecasting. Examples include Macy's, Target, and CVS.
-The voluntary chain is a wholesaler-sponsored group of independent retailers that engages in
group buying and common merchandising. Examples include the Independent Grocers
Alliance, Western Auto, and Do-It Best hardware stores.
-The other type of contractual association is the retailer cooperative, a group of independent
retailers that band together to set up a jointly owned, central wholesale operation and conduct
joint merchandising and promotion efforts. Examples are Associated Grocers and Ace
Hardware. These organizations give independents the buying and promotion economies they
need to meet the prices of corporate chains.
-Another form of contractual retail organization is a franchise. The main difference between
franchise organizations and other contractual systems (voluntary chains and retail cooperatives)
is that franchise systems are normally based on some unique product or service; a method of
doing business; or the trade name, goodwill, or patent that the franchisor has developed.
Franchising has been prominent in fast-food restaurants, motels, health and fitness centers, auto
sales and service dealerships, and real estate agencies. Examples include McDonald's, Subway,
and Jiffy Lube.

73) Describe the differences between chain stores and franchises.
Answer: Chain stores consist of two or more outlets that are commonly owned and controlled.
Chain stores have the advantage of buying in larger quantities at lower prices and sharing
resources to hire specialists to help with decisions in pricing, promotion, merchandising,
inventory, and sales forecasting. Franchises are not commonly owned and controlled; instead, a
franchise is a contractual association between a manufacturer, wholesaler, or service
organization and an independent businessperson. The system is normally based on some unique
product or service; a method of doing business; or a trade name, goodwill, or patent that the
franchisor has developed.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
In the 1970s, Shipshewana was only a small town with a hardware store, a grain mill, a shoe
store, a small restaurant, and a grocery store. Over the next two decades, the small town
transformed into an international tourist attraction, attracting thousands of tourists who were
intrigued by the lifestyle of Shipshewana's largest population—the Amish.
Ben and Mary Miller, having grown up within the Amish faith, decided to capitalize on their
town's popularity and their woodworking skills. Their shop, Indiana Wood, began with a small
display of handmade hickory rocking chairs, Ben Miller's specialty. But within a few months,
the display at Indiana Wood included picnic tables, flower boxes, and small handmade novelty
items. No other shop offers the same variety.
Mary Miller decorated the shop's display room with authentic Amish décor and eventually
hired three Amish friends to sew and embroider napkins and other textiles as customers had
requested such items. In addition, two women from the Amish community sought permission
from the Millers to display home-baked pastries and jellies on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, when
Shipshewana attracts swarms of visitors to its flea market on the south edge of town. The
Millers also hired four more people to help customers throughout the purchasing process and to
provide the required product-related information to the customers.
"Shipshewana is full of specialty shops," Mary Miller stated. "People don't come here to buy
things made in China or Taiwan. They want real, Amish-made goods."
102) The authentic Amish décor of Indiana Wood's contributes to the store's ________.
A) product assortment
B) services mix
C) atmosphere

113) How have shopping centers changed in the past few decades?
Answer: Central business districts were the main form of retail cluster until the 1950s. Every
large city and town had a central business district with department stores, specialty stores,
banks, and movie theaters. When people began moving to the suburbs, however, these central
business districts, with their traffic, parking, and crime problems, began to lose business. In
recent years, many cities have joined with merchants to revive downtown shopping areas,
generally with only mixed success. Currently, shopping centers are described as a group of
retail businesses built on a site that is planned, developed, owned, and managed as a unit. They
are not generally located in the central business districts.

Much of the growth in online sales will go to multichannel retailers who provide service both in

at a much faster rate than retail buying as a whole.

167) Explain the marketing decisions faced by wholesalers.
Answer: Wholesalers are faced with the marketing decisions of segmentation and targeting,
differentiation and promotion, and the marketing mix. Progressive wholesalers are adapting
their services to the needs of target customers and are seeking cost-reducing methods of doing
business. Faced with slow growth in their domestic markets and developments such as the
North American Free Trade Association, many large wholesalers are also now going global.
Wholesalers must decide on product and service assortments, prices, promotion, and place.
Wholesalers add customer value though the products and services they offer. Price is also an
important wholesaler decision. Wholesalers usually mark up the cost of goods by a standard
percentage. As their retail and industrial customers face sales and margin declines, these
customers turn to wholesalers, looking for lower prices. Wholesalers may, in turn, cut their
margins on some lines to keep important customers. They may also ask suppliers for special
price breaks in cases when they can turn them into an increase in the supplier's sales. Although
promotion can be critical to wholesaler success, most wholesalers are not promotion minded.
They use largely scattered and unplanned trade advertising, sales promotion, personal selling,
and public relations. They need to develop an overall promotion strategy and make greater use
of supplier promotion materials and programs. Digital and social media are playing an
increasingly important role. Finally, distribution (location) is important. Wholesalers must
choose their locations, facilities, and Web locations carefully.

168) Explain how wholesalers have been able to use technology to cut costs.
Answer: Many wholesalers have invested in automated warehouses and information
technology systems. Delivery time can be cut as orders are fed from the retailer's information
system directly into the wholesaler's. Automated warehouses increase efficiencies and drive
down costs, as mechanical devices can automatically pick up items and take them to a shipping
platform to be assembled. Wholesalers can also use technology for accounting, billing,
inventory control, and forecasting. These computerized, automated, and Web-based systems
help wholesalers contain the costs of ordering, shipping, and inventory holding.

have changed how companies and consumers communicate with each other. These three factors
have led to a new marketing communications model that is specialized to reach smaller
customer segments with messages that are more personalized. Mass marketing can no longer be
solely relied upon to deliver a marketer's message. Although these changes may frighten
marketing communicators, these changes afford tremendous opportunities to reach new

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
John Mayes opened Sparkle Janitorial in 2005. John began his business by acquiring two
contracts for office cleaning services from two local manufacturing facilities. For two years,
John and his wife, Barb, performed the cleaning services alone. After acquiring three additional
cleaning contracts in 2007, John hired two employees. "Up to that point, we had room to grow
but we really had no advertising plan," John stated. "We were relying mostly on word-of-
mouth."
By 2010, Barb hired another two full-time employees to begin Sparkle's new endeavor: carpet
cleaning in homes and offices. "Competition was getting tough for both of our services at that
point," Barb added. "We ran a local radio spot three times each week. Then we had an
advertiser print coupons on placemats. That gave us a little more exposure."
John and Barb Mayes admit that they did not realize the value of a sound promotional plan
earlier. "We wish we would have put together something catchy with a jingle long before now,"
they said.
96) In a recent radio spot, John and Barb gave a quick explanation of Sparkle's cleaning process
and a description of the value consumers receive for their money. This is an example of a(n)
________ appeal.

objectives and define the response sought, whether it is awareness, knowledge, liking,
preference, conviction, or purchase. Then a message should be constructed with an effective
content and structure. Media must be selected, both for personal and nonpersonal
communication. The marketer should find highly credible sources to deliver messages. Finally,
the communicator must collect feedback by watching how much of the market becomes aware,
tries the product, and is satisfied in the process.

118) Describe the six buyer-readiness stages along with the marketing strategies used at each
stage.
Answer: The six buyer-readiness stages are awareness, knowledge, liking, preference,
conviction, and purchase. A marketer might use teaser ads to create interest, anticipation, and
curiosity at the awareness stage. Next, marketers want to inform potential buyers of the
product's high quality and its many features. Beyond knowledge, marketers want to move
consumers to have stronger feelings about the product, going from liking to preference to
conviction, or believing that a product is the best for them. A combination of promotion tools
can be used to create positive feelings and a customer connection with the brand. The final
stage is purchase, which marketers may influence through the use of premiums, upgrades, or
rebates.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
John Mayes opened Sparkle Janitorial in 2005. John began his business by acquiring two
contracts for office cleaning services from two local manufacturing facilities. For two years,
John and his wife, Barb, performed the cleaning services alone. After acquiring three additional
cleaning contracts in 2007, John hired two employees. "Up to that point, we had room to grow
but we really had no advertising plan," John stated. "We were relying mostly on word-of-
mouth."
By 2010, Barb hired another two full-time employees to begin Sparkle's new endeavor: carpet
cleaning in homes and offices. "Competition was getting tough for both of our services at that
point," Barb added. "We ran a local radio spot three times each week. Then we had an
advertiser print coupons on placemats. That gave us a little more exposure."
John and Barb Mayes admit that they did not realize the value of a sound promotional plan
earlier. "We wish we would have put together something catchy with a jingle long before now,"
they said.
146) When starting their business, John and Barb would most likely have benefitted from
understanding ________.
A) social media
B) buzz marketing
C) public relations campaigns

157) Discuss sales promotion.
Answer: Sales promotion includes a wide assortment of tools—coupons, contests, discounts,
premiums, and others—all of which have many unique qualities. They attract consumer
attention, offer strong incentives to purchase, and can be used to dramatize product offers and
boost sagging sales. Sales promotions invite and reward quick response. Whereas advertising
says, "Buy our product," sales promotion says, "Buy it now." Sales promotion effects are often
short-lived, however, and often are not as effective as advertising or personal selling in building
long-run brand preference and customer relationships.

Answer: Public relations is very believable—news stories, features, sponsorships, and events
seem more real and believable to readers than ads do. PR can also reach many prospects who
avoid salespeople and advertisements—the message gets to buyers as "news" rather than as a
sales-directed communication. And, as with advertising, public relations can dramatize a
company or product. Marketers tend to underuse public relations or use it as an afterthought.
Yet a well-thought-out public relations campaign used with other promotion mix elements can
be very effective and economical.

Answer: Although there are many forms of direct marketing—direct mail and catalogs, online
marketing, mobile marketing, social media and others—they all share four distinctive
characteristics. Direct marketing is less public: The message is normally directed to a specific
person. Direct marketing is immediate and customized: Messages can be prepared very quickly
and can be tailored to appeal to specific consumers. Finally, direct marketing is interactive: It
allows a dialogue between the marketing team and the consumer, and messages can be altered
depending on the consumer's response. Thus, direct marketing is well suited to highly targeted
marketing efforts and building one-to-one customer relationships.

Answer: Using the pull strategy, the producer directs its marketing activities toward final
consumers to induce them to buy the product; if the pull strategy is effective, consumers will
then demand the product from channel members, who will in turn demand it from producers.
Using a push strategy, the producer focuses instead on the channel members, persuading them
to carry the product and promote it to final consumers.

163) Discuss the percentage-of-sales method used for setting the total budget for advertising.
Answer: The percentage-of-sales method involves setting the promotion budget at a certain
percentage of current or forecasted sales. The percentage-of-sales method is simple to use and
helps management think about the relationships between promotion spending, selling price, and
profit per unit. It wrongly views sales as the cause of promotion rather than as the result. Thus,
the percentage-of-sales budget is based on the availability of funds rather than on opportunities.
It may prevent the increased spending sometimes needed to turn around falling sales. Finally,
the method does not provide any basis for choosing a specific percentage, except what has been
done in the past or what competitors are doing.

164) Discuss the affordable method of setting the total budget for advertising.
Answer: Some companies use the affordable method: They set the promotion budget at the
level they think the company can afford. Small businesses often use this method, reasoning that
the company cannot spend more on advertising than it has. They start with total revenues,
deduct operating expenses and capital outlays, and then devote some portion of the remaining
funds to advertising.
Unfortunately, this method of setting budgets completely ignores the effects of promotion on
sales. It tends to place promotion last among spending priorities, even in situations in which
advertising is critical to the firm's success. It leads to an uncertain annual promotion budget,
which makes long-range market planning difficult. Although the affordable method can result
in overspending on advertising, it more often results in underspending.

165) What is personal selling? What are the advantages and disadvantages of a firm using
personal selling to promote a product or service?
Answer: Personal selling is the most effective tool at certain stages of the buying process,
particularly in building up buyers' preferences, convictions, and actions. It involves personal
interaction between two or more people, so each person can observe the other's needs and
characteristics and make quick adjustments. Personal selling also allows all kinds of customer
relationships to spring up, ranging from matter-of-fact selling relationships to personal
friendships. An effective salesperson keeps the customer's interests at heart to build a long-term
relationship by solving a customer's problems. Finally, with personal selling, the buyer usually
feels a greater need to listen and respond, even if the response is a polite "No thank-you."
These unique qualities come at a cost, however. A sales force requires a longer-term
commitment than does advertising—although advertising can be turned up or down, the size of
a sales force is harder to change. Personal selling is also the company's most expensive
promotion tool, costing companies on average $600 or more per sales call, depending on the
industry.

166) Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of advertising.
Answer: Advertising can reach masses of geographically dispersed buyers at a low cost per
exposure, and it enables the seller to repeat a message many times. Beyond its reach, large-
scale advertising says something positive about the seller's size, popularity, and success.
Because of advertising's public nature, consumers tend to view advertised products as more
legitimate. Advertising is also very expressive; it allows the company to dramatize its products
through the artful use of visuals, print, sound, and color.
Advertising also has some shortcomings. Although it reaches many people quickly, advertising
is impersonal and lacks the direct persuasiveness of company salespeople. For the most part,
advertising can carry on only a one-way communication with an audience, and the audience
does not feel that it has to pay attention or respond. In addition, advertising can be very costly.

determined, which will often depend on the product's stage in the product life cycle. The third
step is to develop an advertising strategy, which involves message decisions and media
decisions. The last step is to evaluate the effectiveness of the advertising campaign.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Most clients of Second Avenue have learned about the store through word-of-mouth
communication. This small retailer of quality secondhand children's clothing thrives on the sale
of a vast inventory of children's clothing placed on consignment. "Because small children grow
so quickly," Second Avenue's owner commented, "they often outgrow many of their clothes
before they've hardly been worn!"
Second Avenue provides a way for people to sell their children's clothing, earn a few dollars,
and buy the next larger size. "We're extremely picky about the condition of the clothing we
stock," the owner stated, "but we sell most items at a 60-percent discount."
94) Which of the following media options would be the LEAST costly for Second Avenue's
promotional efforts?
A) periodic advertising in a local newspaper that follows a regular monthly schedule

131) How are companies taking advantage of interactive technologies to tap consumers for
message ideas and actual ads? What are the benefits and disadvantages of consumer-generated
advertising?
Answer: Companies can now search existing video sites such as YouTube, set up their own
Web sites, create accounts on social networks such as Facebook, and sponsor ad-creation
contests. Several companies, such as Coca-Cola, MasterCard, and Frito-Lay, have used
consumer-generated ads in national promotions. Consumer-generated advertising offers
companies a way to gather new perspectives on their products and develop insights into how
their products are used and seen by actual consumers. Also, consumer-generated advertising is
very inexpensive. On the other hand, companies do not control consumer-generated material,
which can lead to conflicting, or even negative, messages about a brand.

Answer: First, the advertiser needs to decide on reach, frequency, and impact. Reach is a
measure of the percentage of people who are exposed to the advertisement; frequency is the
measure of how many times the average person is exposed to the message; impact is how
people feel about the advertisement. Next, media planners need to choose among major media
types: television, newspapers, magazines, direct mail, radio, outdoor, and Internet. They may
also select newer digital media such as cell phones. After the media type is selected, the
specific media vehicles must be identified. The last decision is media timing, which involves
determining how to schedule the advertising over the course of a year.

high cost per exposure and "junk mail" image.
-Magazines: Strengths are high audience selectivity, credibility, and good pass-along readership;
weaknesses are high costs and long lead times.
-Radio: Strengths are good local acceptance and low cost; weaknesses are low attention and
fleeting exposure to messages.
-Outdoor: Strengths are flexibility, low cost, and low message competition; weaknesses are low
audience selectivity and creative limitations.
-Internet: Strengths include high selectivity, low cost, and interactive capabilities; weaknesses
are audience control of exposure and potentially low impact.

134) Advertisers should regularly evaluate two types of advertising results: the communication
effects and the sales and profit effects. How are these two results measured?
Answer: Measuring the communication effects of an ad or ad campaign tells whether the ads
and media are communicating the ad message well. Individual ads can be tested before or after
they are run. Before an ad is placed, the advertiser can show it to consumers, ask how they like
it, and measure message recall or attitude changes resulting from it. After an ad is run, the
advertiser can measure how the ad affected consumer recall or product awareness, knowledge,
and preference. Pre- and post-evaluations of communication effects can be made for entire
advertising campaigns as well. Sales and profit effects of advertising are often much harder to
measure. Sales and profits are affected by many factors other than advertising—such as product
features, price, and availability. One way to measure the sales and profit effects of advertising is
to compare past sales and profits with past advertising expenditures. Another way is through
experiments. For example, to test the effects of different advertising spending levels, a
company could vary the amount it spends on advertising in different market areas and measure
the differences in the resulting sales and profit levels. More complex experiments could be
designed to include other variables, such as differences in the ads or media used.

135) Explain how seasonality impacts media timing.
Answer: An advertiser must decide how to schedule the advertising over the course of a year.
Suppose sales of a product peak in December and drop in March (for winter outdoor gear, for
instance). The firm can vary its advertising to follow the seasonal pattern, oppose the seasonal
pattern, or be the same all year. Most firms do some seasonal advertising. For example, Mars
currently runs M&M's special ads for almost every holiday and "season," from Easter, Fourth
of July, and Halloween to the Super Bowl season and the Oscar season. The Picture People, the
national chain of portrait studios, advertises more heavily before major holidays, such as
Christmas, Easter, Valentine's Day, and Halloween. Some marketers do only seasonal
advertising: for instance, P&G advertises its Vicks NyQuil only during the cold and flu season.

Answer: Today's agencies employ specialists who can often perform advertising tasks better

company's problems, along with lots of experience from working with different clients and
situations. So, today, even companies with strong advertising departments of their own use
advertising agencies. Most large advertising agencies have the staff and resources to handle all
phases of an advertising campaign for their clients, from creating a marketing plan to
developing ad campaigns and preparing, placing, and evaluating ads and other brand content.

Most clients of Second Avenue have learned about the store through word-of-mouth
communication. This small retailer of quality secondhand children's clothing thrives on the sale
of a vast inventory of children's clothing placed on consignment. "Because small children grow
so quickly," Second Avenue's owner commented, "they often outgrow many of their clothes
before they've hardly been worn!"
Second Avenue provides a way for people to sell their children's clothing, earn a few dollars,
and buy the next larger size. "We're extremely picky about the condition of the clothing we
stock," the owner stated, "but we sell most items at a 60-percent discount."
147) The owner of Second Avenue wants to establish a community clothing drive to collect
clothes for a local children's shelter. The owner is planning to set up collection barrels outside
Second Avenue. In this case, which of the following public relations tools is being used by the
owner?

153) Explain why a public relations campaign can be a more cost-effective option for
corporations than an advertising campaign.
Answer: Public relations can have a strong impact on public awareness at a much lower cost
than advertising can. The company does not pay for the space or time in the media. Rather, it
pays for a staff to develop and circulate information and to manage events. If the company
develops an interesting story or event, it could be picked up by several different media, having
the same effect as advertising that would cost millions of dollars. And it would have more
credibility than advertising.

166) Public relations specialists use several tools. Identify three of these tools and describe how
they can help a company communicate with the public.
Answer: Students' answers may include any three of the following.
PR professionals find or create favorable news about the company and its products or people.
Sometimes news stories occur naturally, and sometimes the PR person can suggest events or
activities that would create news.
Speeches can also create product and company publicity. Increasingly, company executives
must field questions from the media or give talks at trade associations or sales meetings, and
these events can either build or hurt the company's image.
Another common PR tool is special events, ranging from news conferences, press tours, grand
openings, and fireworks displays to laser shows, hot air balloon releases, multimedia
presentations, or educational programs designed to reach and interest target publics.
Public relations people also prepare written materials to reach and influence their target
markets. These materials include annual reports, brochures, articles, and company newsletters
and magazines.
Audiovisual materials, such as slide-and-sound programs, DVDs, and online videos are being
used increasingly as communication tools.
Corporate identity materials can also help create a corporate identity that the public
immediately recognizes. Logos, stationery, brochures, signs, business forms, business cards,
buildings, uniforms, and company cars and trucks—all become marketing tools when they are
attractive, distinctive, and memorable.
Companies can improve public goodwill by contributing money and time to public service
activities.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Reliable Tools Company is a manufacturer of hubs and axles for the trailer and heavy truck
industry. Although Reliable Tools only has 15 customers, the company is the sole supplier of
hub and axle components to those customers. Monthly sales at Reliable Tools are
approximately $1 million. "You might say we have all our eggs in one basket," says owner
Arthur Deetz.
It is critical that a competent sales force be maintained in order to nurture those few but large
accounts. Ninety-five percent of Reliable Tools' customers are located in Michigan, Ohio, and
Indiana, which means that travel time to all customers is relatively short. However, given the
nature of the industry, time spent with each customer is crucial.
59) How would a customer sales force structure benefit Reliable Tools?
A) It would eliminate the need for the company's salespeople to travel to meet customers.
B) It would enable the company's salespeople to build close relationships with customers.

must also teach them how to sell effectively and train them in the basics of the selling process.
Salespeople also need to know and identify with the company, its products, and its competitors.
Therefore, an effective training program teaches them about the company's objectives,
organization, products, and the strategies of major competitors.

salespeople as valued contributors and allow virtually unlimited opportunity for income and
promotion. Not surprisingly, these companies enjoy higher sales force performance and less
turnover.

potential benefits of each structure?
Answer: In the territorial sales force structure, each salesperson is assigned to an exclusive
geographic area and sells the company's full line of products or services to all customers in that
territory. This organization clearly defines each person's job, fixes accountability, and increases
the person's desire to build local business relationships that improve selling effectiveness.
The product sales force structure allows the sales force to sell along product lines; the seller
becomes very knowledgeable about products.
The customer sales force structure organizes its sales force along customer or industry lines.
This can help a company build closer relationships with important customers.

90) Why are more companies using team selling? What are its pros and cons?
Answer: Team selling is useful for servicing large, complex accounts. Sales teams can uncover
problems, solutions, and sales opportunities that no individual salesperson could. In many
cases, the move to team selling mirrors similar changes in customers' buying organizations.
Many large customer companies have implemented team-based purchasing, requiring marketers
to employ equivalent team-based selling. When dealing with large, complex accounts, one
salesperson can't be an expert in everything the customer needs. Instead, selling is done by
strategic account teams, quarterbacked by senior account managers or customer business
managers.
Team selling does have some pitfalls, however. For example, salespeople are by nature
competitive and have often been trained and rewarded for outstanding individual performance.
Salespeople who are used to having customers all to themselves may have trouble learning to
work with and trust others on a team. In addition, selling teams can confuse or overwhelm
customers who are used to working with only one salesperson. Finally, difficulties in evaluating
individual contributions to the team selling effort can create some sticky compensation issues.

91) How do successful companies recruit and train their salespeople? What does an effective
training program teach salespeople?
Answer: When recruiting, a company should analyze the sales job itself and the characteristics
of its most successful salespeople to identify the traits needed by a successful salesperson in
their industry. Then it must recruit the right salespeople. The human resources department looks
for applicants by getting names from current salespeople, using employment agencies,
searching the Internet, placing classified ads, and working through college placement services.
Another source is to attract top salespeople from other companies. Proven salespeople need less
training and can be productive immediately.
New salespeople may spend anywhere from a few weeks or months to a year or more in
training. After the initial training ends, most companies provide continuing sales training via
seminars, sales meetings, and Internet e-learning throughout the salesperson's career. Many
companies are now using imaginative and sophisticated e-learning techniques to make sales
training more efficient.
Salespeople also need to know and identify with the company, its products, and its competitors.
Therefore, an effective training program teaches them about the company's objectives,
organization, products, and the strategies of major competitors.

92) Describe some of the methods used to supervise salespeople and help them work more
efficiently.
Answer: Through supervision, or helping salespeople "work smart," companies can help
salespeople do the right things in the right way. This includes helping salespeople identify
target customers and manage their time. A weekly, monthly, or annual call plan is used in many
companies to show salespeople which customers and potential customers to call on within a
given time period and which activities to carry out. Companies often use time-and-duty-
analysis. In addition to time spent selling, the salesperson spends time traveling, waiting, taking
breaks, and doing administrative chores. Companies are always looking for ways to save time
—simplifying administrative duties, developing better sales call and routing plans, supplying
more and better customer information, and using phone, e-mail, or Internet conferencing
instead of traveling.
Many firms have adopted sales force automation systems: computerized, digitized sales force
operations that let salespeople work more effectively anytime, anywhere. Companies now
routinely equip their salespeople with technologies such as laptops or tablets, smartphones,
wireless connections, videoconferencing technologies, and customer-contact and relationship
management software. Armed with these technologies, salespeople can more effectively and
efficiently profile customers and prospects, analyze and forecast sales, schedule sales calls,
make presentations, prepare sales and expense reports, and manage account relationships. The
result is better time management, improved customer service, lower sales costs, and higher
sales performance. In all, technology has reshaped the ways in which salespeople carry out
their duties and engage customers.

93) Explain the methods of evaluating the performance of a sales force. Why is the evaluation
of a company's sales force considered necessary?
Answer: Management gets information about its salespeople in several ways. The most
important source is sales reports, including weekly or monthly work plans and longer-term
territory marketing plans. Salespeople also write up their completed activities on call reports
and turn in expense reports for which they are partly or wholly reimbursed. The company can
also monitor the sales and profit performance data in the salesperson's territory. Additional
information comes from personal observation, customer surveys, and talks with other
salespeople. Using various sales force reports and other information, sales management
evaluates the members of the sales force. It evaluates salespeople on their ability to "plan their
work and work their plan." Formal evaluation forces management to develop and communicate
clear standards for judging performance. It also provides salespeople with constructive
feedback and motivates them to perform well.
On a broader level, management should evaluate the performance of the sales force as a whole.
Is the sales force accomplishing its customer relationship, sales, and profit objectives? Is it
working well with other areas of the marketing and company organization? Are sales force
costs in line with outcomes? As with other marketing activities, the company wants to measure
its return on sales investment.

94) Describe social selling and what changes it is bringing to the selling process.
Answer: The fastest-growing sales trend is the explosion in social selling—the use of online,
mobile, and social media to engage customers, build stronger customer relationships, and
augment sales performance. New digital sales force technologies are creating exciting new
avenues for connecting with and engaging customers in the digital and social media age. Used
properly, online and social media technologies will make salespeople more productive and
effective. The new digital technologies are providing salespeople with powerful tools for
identifying and learning about prospects, engaging customers, creating customer value, closing
sales, and nurturing customer relationships. Social selling technologies can produce big
organizational benefits for sales forces. They help conserve salespeople's valuable time, save
travel dollars, and give salespeople new vehicles for selling and servicing accounts.
Social selling hasn't really changed the fundamentals of selling. Sales forces have always taken
the primary responsibility for reaching out to and engaging customers and managing customer
relationships. Now, more of that is being done digitally. However, online and social media are
dramatically changing the customer buying process. As a result, they are also changing the
selling process. In today's digital world, many customers no longer rely as much as they once
did on information and assistance provided by salespeople. Instead, they carry out more of the
buying process on their own—especially the early stages.
In response to this new digital buying environment, sellers are reorienting their selling
processes around the new customer buying process. They are "going where customers are"—
social media, forums, online communities, blogs—in order to engage customers earlier. They
are engaging customers not just where and when they are buying, but also where and when they
are learning about and evaluating what they will buy.
Salespeople now routinely use digital tools that monitor customer social media exchanges to
spot trends, identify prospects, and learn what customers would like to buy, how they feel about
a vendor, and what it would take to make a sale. Today's sales forces are also ramping up their
own use of social media to engage customers throughout the buying process.

127) What are the different steps in the selling process? Briefly describe each step.
Answer: The selling process consists of seven steps: prospecting and qualifying, preapproach,
approach, presentation and demonstration, handling objections, closing, and follow-up.
1. The first step in the selling process is prospecting, in which a salesperson or company
identifies qualified potential customers.
2. Before calling on a prospect, the salesperson should learn as much as possible about the
organization (what it needs, who is involved in the buying) and its buyers (their characteristics
and buying styles). This step is known as preapproach.
3. The sales step in which a salesperson meets the customer for the first time is known as
approach. During the approach step, the salesperson should know how to meet and greet the
buyer and get the relationship off to a good start.
4. During the presentation step of the selling process, the salesperson tells the "value story" to
the buyer, showing how the company's offer solves the customer's problems.
5. The sales step in which a salesperson seeks out, clarifies, and overcomes any customer
objections to buying is known as handling objections.
6. After handling the prospect's objections, the salesperson next tries to close the sale. This step
is known as closing, in which a salesperson asks the customer for an order.
7. The last step in the selling process—follow-up—is necessary if the salesperson wants to
ensure customer satisfaction and repeat business. In this step, a salesperson follows up after the
sale to ensure customer satisfaction and repeat business.

128) What is the follow-up step of the selling process? Why is it important?
Answer: The follow-up step is important if the salesperson wants to ensure customer
satisfaction and repeat business. Right after closing, the salesperson should complete any
details on delivery time, purchase terms, and other matters. The salesperson then should
schedule a follow-up call after the buyer receives the initial order to make sure proper
installation, instruction, and servicing occur. This visit would reveal any problems, assure the
buyer of the salesperson's interest, and reduce any buyer concerns that might have arisen since
the sale.

129) How are the personal selling process and customer relationship management interrelated?
What are the primary requirements of value selling?
Answer: The selling process should be understood in the context of building and maintaining
profitable customer relationships, as companies are interested in more than simply securing a
one-time sale. Successful sales organizations recognize that winning and keeping accounts
requires more than making good products and directing the sales force to close lots of sales. If
the company wishes only to close sales and capture short-term business, it can do this by
simply slashing its prices to meet or beat those of competitors. Instead, most companies want
their salespeople to practice value selling—demonstrating and delivering superior customer
value and capturing a return on that value that is fair for both the customer and the company.
Unfortunately, in the heat of closing sales—especially in a tight economy—salespeople often
take the easy way out by cutting prices rather than selling value. Sales management's challenge
is to transform salespeople from customer advocates for price cuts into company advocates for
value. Value selling requires listening to customers, understanding their needs, and carefully
coordinating the whole company's efforts to create lasting relationships based on customer
value.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Reliable Tools Company is a manufacturer of hubs and axles for the trailer and heavy truck
industry. Although Reliable Tools only has 15 customers, the company is the sole supplier of
hub and axle components to those customers. Monthly sales at Reliable Tools are
approximately $1 million. "You might say we have all our eggs in one basket," says owner
Arthur Deetz.
It is critical that a competent sales force be maintained in order to nurture those few but large
accounts. Ninety-five percent of Reliable Tools' customers are located in Michigan, Ohio, and
Indiana, which means that travel time to all customers is relatively short. However, given the
nature of the industry, time spent with each customer is crucial.
159) Which of the following promotions would be most appropriate for Reliable Tools to use in
its attempt to promote its products and generate new business leads?
A) rebates and price packs
B) premiums

166) Briefly explain the major sales promotion tools.
Answer: Consumer promotions include a wide range of tools—from samples, coupons,
refunds, premiums, and point-of-purchase displays to contests, sweepstakes, and event
sponsorships. Marketers also promote their brands through event marketing. They can create
their own brand-marketing events or serve as sole or participating sponsors of events created by
others.
Trade promotions can persuade resellers to carry a brand, give it shelf space, promote it in
advertising, and push it to consumers. Manufacturers often have to offer price-offs, allowances,
buy-back guarantees, or free goods to retailers and wholesalers to get products on the shelf and,
once there, to keep them on it.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
The Treble Clef sells music books, musical instruments, and novelty gifts of a musical nature.
In recent years, owner Gary Zahn has served as the local representative of several musical
instrument manufacturers, providing a contact person for three local schools. He sends a sample
of a manufacturer's products to schools that request a demonstration or presentation. "If we
don't have it, we can definitely get it for you," Gary tells all Treble Clef visitors and customers.
Most walk-ins are particularly interested in a specific piece of sheet music from a particular era
or just browsing among the hundreds of music knick-knacks in the store. Gary spends most of
his time making presentations to beginners at the local schools and making biweekly visits to
the schools to deliver instruments, make minor repairs, or pick up instruments to ship to the
manufacturer for more complicated repairs.
After establishing a loyal customer base, Gary was convinced that a Treble Clef Web site could
benefit a variety of customers. He began with a simple Web site that provided information
about the store and the types of gifts and services available. The site received so much response
that Gary added a question-and-answer option. Questions poured in, ranging from "Where can I
get sheet music for 'Hello, Dolly'?" to "Do you carry clarinet reeds?" to "My saxophone needs
two new pads. When will you be at Elmhurst School to repair it?" The Web site is now able to
accept credit card orders, and gifts can even be wrapped and shipped for no extra charge.
"This Web site idea was fantastic!" Gary admitted. "It allows us to be so responsive. And our
novelties sales have doubled!"
18) Which kind of Web site does Treble Clef use?
A) branded community Web site
B) corporate Web site
C) investor relations Web site
D) marketing Web site
E) online Web site

71) Identify the major advantage of the following forms of digital and social media marketing:
Web sites, viral marketing, e-mail, blogs, social media, and mobile ads and apps.
Answer: Web sites are designed to engage the customers. Marketing Web sites want to move
them closer to a direct purchase or other marketing outcomes. Branded community Web sites
want to provide content that builds closer customer relationships and generates engagement
with and between the brand and its customers.
Viral marketing can be very inexpensive when customers find and pass along the message or
promotion.
E-mail lets marketers send highly targeted, tightly personalized, relationship-building
messages.
Blogs can offer a fresh, original, personal and cheap way to enter into consumer online and
social media conversations.
Social media first and foremost are targeted and personal.
Mobile ads and apps are used to increase convenience for customers, whether in making a
purchase or accessing information.

72) Compare and contrast the purpose and content of a branded community Web site to that of a
marketing Web site.
Answer: Branded community Web sites are designed to present brand content that engages
consumers and builds closer customer relationships, rather than to sell the company's products
directly. Such sites typically offer a rich variety of brand information, videos, blogs, activities,
and other features that build closer customer relationships and generate engagement with and
between the brand and its customers.
In contrast, marketing Web sites are designed to engage consumers in an interaction that will
move them closer to a direct purchase. A marketing Web site allows customers to view,
research, and purchase specific items.

73) What are the characteristics of a successful Web site?
Answer: To attract visitors, companies aggressively promote their Web sites in offline print and
broadcast advertising and through ads and links on other sites. The key is to create enough
engaging and valued content to get consumers to come to the site, stick around, and come back
again.
At the very least, a Web site should be easy to use and visually appealing. Ultimately, however,
Web sites must also be USEFUL. When it comes to online browsing and shopping, most people
prefer substance over style and function over flash. Thus, effective Web sites contain deep and
useful information, interactive tools that help find and evaluate content of interest, links to
other related sites, changing promotional offers, and entertaining features that lend relevant
excitement.

74) What are the strengths and weaknesses of e-mail marketing?
Answer: E-mail is still the king as 91 percent of all U.S. consumers use e-mail every day, with
65 percent of those opened on mobile devices. E-mail can be 40 times more effective at
capturing customers than Facebook and Twitter combined. Thanks to low costs, e-mail
marketing brings one of the highest marketing returns on investment. It lets marketers send
highly targeted, personalized, relationship-building messages that are colorful, inviting, and
interactive. However, spam has produced consumer irritation and frustration as it now accounts
for 70 percent of all e-mail sent worldwide. Marketers want to add value for consumers but not
be intrusive and annoying.

91) Describe two ways that marketers can participate in online social networks. What are the
challenges and advantages of these approaches?
Answer: Marketers can engage in social media in two ways: They can use existing social
media or they can set up their own. Using existing social media seems the easiest. Thus, many
brands now use a host of social media sites. Although large social media networks are most
familiar, countless niche social media have also emerged. Niche online social networks cater to
the needs of smaller communities of likeminded people, making them ideal vehicles for
marketers who want to target special interest groups. Beyond these independent social media,
many companies have created their own online brand communities.
Using social media presents both advantages and challenges. On the plus side, social media are
targeted and personal, interactive, immediate and timely. Social media can be very cost
effective. Perhaps the biggest advantage of social media is their engagement and social sharing
capabilities. Social media are especially well suited to creating customer engagement and
community—for getting customers involved with the brand and with each other.
Social media marketing also present challenges. First, many companies are still experimenting
with how to use them effectively, and results are hard to measure. Second, such social networks
are largely user controlled. The company's goal in using social media is to make the brand a
part of consumers' conversations and their lives. However, marketers must become a valued
part of the online experience by developing a steady flow of engaging content.

information, incentives, and choices at the moment they are expressing an interest or when they
are in a position to make a buying choice. The rich-media ads can create substantial
engagement and impact. They can enrich the brand experience by providing information or
even entertainment. They can target "anytime, anywhere, and everywhere."

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
The Treble Clef sells music books, musical instruments, and novelty gifts of a musical nature.
In recent years, owner Gary Zahn has served as the local representative of several musical
instrument manufacturers, providing a contact person for three local schools. He sends a sample
of a manufacturer's products to schools that request a demonstration or presentation. "If we
don't have it, we can definitely get it for you," Gary tells all Treble Clef visitors and customers.
Most walk-ins are particularly interested in a specific piece of sheet music from a particular era
or just browsing among the hundreds of music knick-knacks in the store. Gary spends most of
his time making presentations to beginners at the local schools and making biweekly visits to
the schools to deliver instruments, make minor repairs, or pick up instruments to ship to the
manufacturer for more complicated repairs.
After establishing a loyal customer base, Gary was convinced that a Treble Clef Web site could
benefit a variety of customers. He began with a simple Web site that provided information
about the store and the types of gifts and services available. The site received so much response
that Gary added a question-and-answer option. Questions poured in, ranging from "Where can I
get sheet music for 'Hello, Dolly'?" to "Do you carry clarinet reeds?" to "My saxophone needs
two new pads. When will you be at Elmhurst School to repair it?" The Web site is now able to
accept credit card orders, and gifts can even be wrapped and shipped for no extra charge.
"This Web site idea was fantastic!" Gary admitted. "It allows us to be so responsive. And our
novelties sales have doubled!"
136) Gary sends samples of sheet music to schools for demonstration or presentation. Which of
the following types of marketing is being illustrated from this statement?
A) kiosk marketing
B) viral marketing
C) direct-mail marketing

152) Why is the use of direct-response television growing in popularity?
Answer: Direct-response television (DRTV) marketing takes one of two major forms: direct-
response television advertising and interactive TV (iTV) advertising. Using direct-response
television advertising, direct marketers air television spots, often 60 or 120 seconds in length,
which persuasively describe a product and give customers a toll-free number or a Web site for
ordering. It also includes full 30-minute or longer advertising programs, called infomercials, for
a single product. Successful direct-response advertising campaigns can ring up big sales.
Interactive TV (iTV) lets viewers interact with television programming and advertising. Thanks
to technologies such as interactive cable systems, Internet-ready smart TVs, and smartphones
and tablets, consumers can now use their TV remotes, phones, or other devices to obtain more
information or make purchases directly from TV ads. Interactive ads and infomercials are
appearing not just on TV, but also on mobile, online, and social media platforms, adding even
more TV-like interactive direct marketing venues.

154) How can firms that use new direct marketing technologies avoid backlash from consumers
who view such marketing as an invasion of privacy?
Answer: Marketers should always target their direct marketing offers carefully and bring real
value to customers through direct marketing. Firms can opt for database marketing so that
consumers receive offers that closely match their interests. Using sophisticated computer
technologies, direct marketers can mine these databases to "microtarget" their selling efforts.
Most marketers have become highly skilled at collecting and analyzing detailed consumer
information.

concerns?
Answer: Some companies use a nonprofit self-regulatory organization that audits a company's
security and privacy measures and then approves Web sites, mobile apps, e-mail marketing and
other online and social media channels that meet its privacy and security standards. The Direct
Marketing Association launched a Privacy Promise that asks member companies to agree to
notify customers when any personal information is rented, sold, or exchanged with others. They
must also honor customer requests to opt-out of receiving further solicitations or having their
contact information transferred to other marketers. Finally, they must abide by the DMA's
Preference Service by removing the names of consumers who do not wish to receive mail,
phone, or e-mail offers.

Paper catalogs create emotional connections with customers that digital sales spaces can't, and
through online catalogs, marketers can use real-time merchandising, adding or removing
products based on their availability.
Direct-response television marketing allows live demonstrations without salespeople having to
visit buyers' homes or businesses.
Kiosk marketing places information and ordering machines in convenient places, such as
airports, stores, and malls.

157) How has the implementation of the National Do Not Call Registry changed telephone
marketing?
Answer: The National Do Not Call Registry was created by legislation, passed in 2003; it bans
most business telemarketing calls to registered phone numbers. However, people can still
receive calls from nonprofit groups, politicians, and companies with which they have recently
done business. Millions of customers have joined the do-not-call list, and businesses that break
the laws can be fined heavily. The use of unsolicited outbound telemarketing has greatly
decreased due to the law, but inbound consumer telemarketing and outbound business-to-
business telemarketing remain strong and growing. Many telemarketers are shifting their call-
center activity from making unsolicited cold calls on often resentful customers to managing
existing customer relationships. They are developing "opt-in" calling systems, in which they
provide useful information and offers to customers who have invited the company to contact
them by phone or e-mail.

Answer: Web site activities provide extensive personal information. This may leave consumers
open to information abuse if companies make unauthorized use of the information in marketing
their products or exchanging databases with other companies. Critics worry that through
database marketing, marketers know too much about consumers' lives and may not use that
information responsibly, taking unfair advantage of consumers.

75) Discuss the need to understand competitors as well as customers through competitor
analysis.
Answer: In order to prepare an effective marketing strategy, a company must consider its
competitors as well as its customers. Building profitable customer relationships requires
satisfying target consumer needs better than competitors do. A company must continually
analyze competitors and develop competitive marketing strategies that position it effectively
against competitors and give it the strongest possible competitive advantage. Competitor
analysis first involves identifying the company's major competitors, using both an industry-
based and a market-based analysis. The company then gathers information on competitors'
objectives, strategies, strengths and weaknesses, and reaction patterns. With this information in
hand, it can select competitors to attack or avoid. Competitive intelligence must be collected,
interpreted, and distributed continuously. Company marketing managers should be able to
obtain full and reliable information about any competitor affecting their decisions.

rivalry among groups. Give examples.
Answer: First, some of the strategic groups may appeal to overlapping customer segments. For
example, no matter what their strategy, all major appliance manufacturers will go after the
apartment and homebuilders segment. Second, the customers may not see much difference in
the offers of different groups; they may see the little difference in quality between GE and
Whirlpool. Finally, members of one strategic group might expand into new strategy segments.
Thus, General Electric's Monogram and Profile lines of appliances compete in the premium-
quality, premium-price line with Viking and Sub-Zero.

77) Marketing managers need a deep understanding of a given competitor's mentality if they
want to anticipate how the competitor will act or react. Discuss the different ways competitors
act or react. Why do they do so? Use examples to support your thoughts.
Answer: Student answers will vary. Each competitor reacts differently. Some do not react
quickly or strongly to a competitor's move. They may feel their customers are loyal; they may
be slow in noticing the move; they may lack the funds to react. Some competitors react only to
certain types of moves and not to others. Other competitors react swiftly and strongly to any
action. For example, Procter & Gamble does not let a new detergent come easily into the
market. Many firms avoid direct competition with P&G and look for easier prey, knowing that
P&G will react fiercely if challenged. In some industries, competitors live in relative harmony;
in others, they fight constantly. Knowing how major competitors react gives the company clues
on how best to attack competitors or how best to defend the company's current positions.

78) An industry often contains "good" competitors and "bad" competitors. Define each term
and discuss scenarios with both "good" and "bad" competitors. How might "good" competitors
choose to react to "bad" competition?
Answer: Student answers will vary. Good competitors play by the rules of the industry. Bad
competitors, in contrast, break the rules. They try to buy share rather than earn it, take large
risks, and play by their own rules. For example, Yahoo! Music Unlimited sees Napster,
Rhapsody, AOL Music, Amazon.com, and most other digital music download services as good
competitors. They share a common platform, so that music bought from any of these
competitors can be played on almost any playback device. However, it sees Apple's iTunes
Music Store as a bad competitor, one that plays by its own rules at the expense of the industry
as a whole. With the iPod, Apple created a closed system with mass appeal. A company might
be smart to support good competitors, aiming its attacks at bad competitors.

79) Discuss the functions and goals of a competitive intelligence system.
Answer: The competitive intelligence system first identifies the vital types of competitive
information needed and the best sources of this information. Then, the system continuously
collects information from the field (sales force, channels, suppliers, market research firms,
trade associations, Web sites) and from published data (government publications, speeches,
articles). Next, the system checks the information for validity and reliability, interprets it, and
organizes it in an appropriate way. Finally, it sends key information to relevant decision makers
and responds to inquiries from managers about competitors.
With this system, company managers will receive timely intelligence information about
competitors in the form of phone calls, e-mails, bulletins, newsletters, and reports. In addition,
managers can connect with the system when they need an interpretation of a competitor's
sudden move, when they want to know a competitor's weaknesses and strengths, or when they
need to know how a competitor will respond to a planned company move.

strategies.
Answer: Overall cost leadership is when the company works hard to achieve the lowest
production and distribution costs. Differentiation is when the company concentrates on creating
a highly differentiated product line and marketing program so that it comes across as the class
leader in the industry. Focus is when the company puts its efforts on serving a few market
segments well rather than going after the whole market. Middle-of-the-roaders are firms that do
not pursue a clear strategy. These firms do the worst.

146) Why is niching profitable?
Answer: The main reason a market nicher can succeed is that it ends up knowing the target
customer group so well that it meets the group's needs better than other firms that casually sell
to that niche. As a result, the nicher can charge a substantial markup over costs because of the
added value. Whereas the mass marketer achieves high volume, the nicher achieves high
margins.

147) Discuss formal and informal marketing strategies and give examples of companies that
follow these strategies.
Answer: Student answers will vary. Many large firms develop formal competitive marketing
strategies and implement them religiously. However, other companies develop strategy in a less
formal and orderly fashion. Some companies, such as Harley-Davidson, Virgin Atlantic
Airways, and BMW's MINI unit succeed by breaking many of the rules of marketing strategy.
Such companies don't operate large marketing departments, conduct expensive marketing
research, spell out elaborate competitive strategies, and spend huge sums on advertising.
Instead, they sketch out strategies on the fly, stretch their limited resources, live close to their
customers, and create more satisfying solutions to customer needs. They form buyer's clubs,
use buzz marketing, and focus on winning customer loyalty. It seems that not all marketing
must follow in the footsteps of marketing giants such as Nike and P&G.

targeted customers. It specializes in satisfying unique customer needs through a close
relationship with and intimate knowledge of the customer. It builds detailed customer databases
for segmenting and targeting, and empowers its marketing people to respond quickly to
customer needs. Customer-intimate companies serve customers who are willing to pay a
premium to get precisely what they want. They will do almost anything to build long-term
customer loyalty and to capture customer lifetime value. Examples include Nordstrom, Lexus,
American Express, British Airways, and Ritz-Carlton hotels.

expand market share. A market challenger is a firm that tries aggressively to expand its market
share by attacking the leader, other runner-up companies, or smaller firms in the industry. The
challenger can select from a variety of direct or indirect attack strategies. A market follower is a
runner-up company that chooses not to rock the boat, usually from fear that it stands to lose
more than it might gain. But the follower is not without a strategy and seeks to use its particular
skills to gain market growth. A market nicher is a smaller firm that is unlikely to attract the
attention of larger firms; it often becomes a specialist in some end use, customer size, specific
customer, geographic areas, or service.

150) Discuss two ways a market challenger can best attack the chosen competitor and achieve
its strategic objectives. Explain when a challenger should use these attacks and provide
examples of companies that have used these methods.
Answer: Student answers will vary. The market challenger may launch a full frontal attack,
matching the competitor's product, advertising, price, and distribution efforts. It attacks the
competitor's strengths rather than its weaknesses. The outcome depends on who has the greater
strength and endurance. If the market challenger has fewer resources than the competitor,
however, a frontal attack makes little sense. Thus, many new market entrants avoid frontal
attacks, knowing that the market leaders can head them off with ad blitzes, price wars, and
other retaliations. Rather than challenging head-on, the challenger can make an indirect attack
on the competitor's weaknesses or on gaps in the competitor's market coverage. It can carve out
toeholds using tactics that the established leaders have trouble responding to or choose to
ignore. Red Bull is a successful example of an indirect attack. PepsiCo challenges Coca-Cola
by launching a full frontal attack.

Answer: In the first orientation, companies are product oriented, paying little attention to either
customers or competitors. In the second orientation, they become customer oriented and start to
pay attention to customers. In the third orientation, when they start to pay attention to
competitors, they become competitor oriented. Today, companies need to be market oriented,
paying balanced attention to both customers and competitors. Rather than simply watching
competitors and trying to beat them on current ways of doing business, companies need to
watch customers and find innovative ways to build profitable customer relationships by
delivering more customer value than competitors do.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Selman & Saks, a maker of men's and women's razors and electric hair trimmers, had little
reason to become involved in the global arena. But after acquiring Wellman Enterprises, whose
largest division engages in a licensing agreement with a German firm to produce women's
hosiery, managers at Selman & Saks wondered whether a company-wide global focus would be
more profitable after all.
Managers at Selman & Saks studied Wellman's licensing agreement in great detail. Even after
seeing the benefits Wellman achieved with the licensing agreement, managers decided that
Selman & Saks would target the French market merely via exporting.
With the assistance of a domestic export department, Selman & Saks razors and hair trimmers
entered France. For six months, sales were mediocre. But after that, sales suffered. Opinions
varied among numerous managers as to the cause of the failure. "Who knows the local market
better than people who live there?" was a comment heard throughout Selman & Saks. "Maybe
we needed an alliance with a French firm, or a licensing agreement, before racing to get there."
71) What did Selman & Saks hope to gain by entering the French market?
A) access to new consumer markets
B) access to less expensive labor
C) access to less expensive materials
D) access to foreign investment incentives
E) the ability to offset domestic economic cycles

Answer: Student answers will vary. Before planning a marketing program in a new country, a
seller should understand the ways that consumers in that country think about and use the
product. To succeed abroad, a company must adapt to local cultural values and traditions rather
than trying to force its own. Examples could include the following: French men use twice as
many grooming aids as women, many Chinese eat on the way to work, and religious imagery
(such as Hindu gods) used in a promotion could easily be considered offensive.

Answer: The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), established in 1947 and
modified in 1994, was designed to promote world trade by reducing tariffs and other
international trade barriers. Member nations, currently numbering 153, have met repeatedly to
reassess trade barriers and set new rules for international trade. The most recently completed
GATT negotiations promote long-term global trade growth, reducing the world's remaining
merchandise tariffs, extending GATT to cover trade in agriculture and a wide range of services,
and toughening international protection of copyrights, patents, trademarks, and other
intellectual property. The most recent round of GATT negotiations resulted in the creation of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) to enforce GATT rules. In general, the WTO acts as an
umbrella organization, overseeing GATT, mediating global disputes, and imposing trade
sanctions.

98) Describe the political-legal factors that a company should consider before deciding to
conduct business in a foreign country.
Answer: A company should consider the country's attitudes toward international buying, as
well as the country's bureaucracy, political stability, and monetary regulations. Some countries
are receptive to foreign firms, offering incentives and favorable operating conditions, while
other countries set restrictions and limitations designed to discourage foreign business. A
country that is politically unstable, with frequent and sometimes violent changes in leadership,
offers a less certain environment for business and financial matters. A country may also have
monetary regulations, such as a blocked currency whose removal from the country is restricted,
that a company should evaluate.

99) Compare the three different types of industrial structures.
Answer: The three different types of industrial structures are subsistence economies, emerging
economies, and industrial economies. In a subsistence economy, most people work in simple
agriculture and consume most of their output. Most people barter for simple goods and
services. An emerging economy is industrializing, with fast growth coming from
manufacturing. These countries typically have a new upper class and a small but growing
middle class. Industrial economies are the major importers and exporters of manufactured
goods and services. They have varied economic activities and large middle classes.

100) Discuss the international marketing objectives and policies a company should try to define
before going abroad.
Answer: Before going abroad, the company should try to define its international marketing
objectives and policies. It should decide what volume of foreign sales it wants. Most companies
start small when they go abroad. The company also needs to choose in how many countries it
wants to market. Companies must be careful not to spread themselves too thin or to expand
beyond their capabilities by operating in too many countries too soon. Next, the company needs
to decide on the types of countries to enter. A country's attractiveness depends on the product,
geographical factors, income and population, political climate, and other factors. The seller may
prefer certain country groups or parts of the world.

129) Discuss direct and indirect exporting. What are the advantages of exporting?
Answer: Companies typically start with indirect exporting, working through independent
international marketing intermediaries. Indirect exporting involves less investment because the
firm does not require an overseas marketing organization or network. It also involves less risk.
International marketing intermediaries bring know-how and services to the relationship, so the
seller normally makes fewer mistakes. Sellers may eventually move into direct exporting,
whereby they handle their own exports. The investment and risk are somewhat greater in this
strategy, but so is the potential return. One advantage of exporting is that the company produces
all of its goods in its home country, so it does not need to invest in manufacturing facilities
abroad. Also, exporting involves the least change in the company's product lines, organization,
investments, and mission. With exporting, a company can make a minimal commitment to a
foreign market and take minimal risks.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Selman & Saks, a maker of men's and women's razors and electric hair trimmers, had little
reason to become involved in the global arena. But after acquiring Wellman Enterprises, whose
largest division engages in a licensing agreement with a German firm to produce women's
hosiery, managers at Selman & Saks wondered whether a company-wide global focus would be
more profitable after all.
Managers at Selman & Saks studied Wellman's licensing agreement in great detail. Even after
seeing the benefits Wellman achieved with the licensing agreement, managers decided that
Selman & Saks would target the French market merely via exporting.
With the assistance of a domestic export department, Selman & Saks razors and hair trimmers
entered France. For six months, sales were mediocre. But after that, sales suffered. Opinions
varied among numerous managers as to the cause of the failure. "Who knows the local market
better than people who live there?" was a comment heard throughout Selman & Saks. "Maybe
we needed an alliance with a French firm, or a licensing agreement, before racing to get there."
146) If Selman & Saks allowed a French company to produce and market razors and trimmers
carrying the company's brand in exchange for a royalty, Selman & Saks would be using the
market entry strategy of ________.

use.
Answer: A company can choose straight product extension, product adaptation, or product
invention. Straight product extension means marketing a product in a foreign market without
any change. This involves no additional product development costs, manufacturing changes, or
new promotion. But it can be costly in the long run if products fail to satisfy foreign consumers.
Product adaptation involves changing the product to meet local conditions or wants. Product
invention consists of creating something new for a specific country market.

159) Compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of standardized global marketing
and adapted global marketing.
Answer: Companies that use standardized global marketing use largely the same marketing
strategy approaches and marketing mix worldwide. On the other hand, with adapted global
marketing, the producer adjusts the marketing strategy and mix elements to each target market,
bearing more costs but hoping for a larger market share and return. Some global marketers
believe that technology is making the world a smaller place and that consumer needs around the
world are becoming more similar. This paves the way for "global brands" and standardized
global marketing. Global branding and standardization, in turn, result in greater brand power
and reduced costs from economies of scale. On the other hand, the marketing concept holds that
marketing programs will be more effective if tailored to the unique needs of each targeted
customer group. Despite global convergence, consumers in different countries still have widely
varied cultural backgrounds and still differ significantly in their needs and wants, spending
power, product preferences, and shopping patterns. Standardized global marketing does not
take these differences into account and may therefore be less effective, albeit less expensive.

three ways these divisions can be organized.
Answer: Many companies get involved in several international markets and ventures, such as
exporting to one country, licensing to another, having a joint ownership venture in a third, and
owning a subsidiary in a fourth. With increased international activity, the company will need to
move from simply having an export department to having more specialized international
divisions or subsidiaries. International divisions are organized in a variety of ways. An
international division's corporate staff consists of marketing, manufacturing, research, finance,
planning, and personnel specialists. It plans for and provides services to various operating units,
which can be organized in one of three ways. They can be geographical organizations, with
country managers who are responsible for salespeople, sales branches, distributors, and
licensees in their respective countries. Or the operating units can be world product groups, each
responsible for worldwide sales of different product groups. Finally, operating units can be
international subsidiaries, each responsible for its own sales and profits.

Refer to the scenario below to answer the following question(s).
Bryant and Anne are the owners of the Good Green Grocer, a small but successful chain of
organic food stores. The organic food sold by Good Green Grocer is of good quality. Also, it is
tasty and has long-term health benefits. Bryant and Anne's business has expanded as more and
more consumers are interested in eating organic foods. What started as one shop in Vermont has
expanded to 15 stores in Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Maine. Much to their
delight, Bryant and Ann have found that many people are willing to pay a bit more for food that
is organically grown.
Sunday ads for the Good Green Grocer run in area newspapers, with special promotional prices
offered for a list of the "Top Ten Take Homes" each week. Regular customers of the Good
Green Grocer know that the promotional items often run out of stock by mid-week, so the store
typically sees its heaviest traffic on Sunday and Monday.
61) Some customers believe that the Good Green Grocer purposefully runs weekly promotional
prices on items that are low in stock, leaving most customers who come to the store hoping for
lower prices but unable to buy the out-of-stock sale items. If this were true, then the Good
Green Grocer would most likely be accused of ________.

Answer: Marketing critics believe that the psychological value advertising may add to a
product is not worth the higher retail prices that must be charged to finance the advertising that
creates the psychological value. Marketers believe that consumers want and are willing to pay
more for the psychological benefits—such as feeling wealthy, attractive, or special—created by
advertising.

73) Explain why most marketers avoid deceptive practices.
Answer: Deceptive practices make consumers believe they are buying something more than
what they are actually getting; when consumers do not get what they expect, they will switch to
more reliable products. Deceptive practices prohibit marketers from building value and trust
with their customers, both keys to profitable customer relationships.

Answer: Marketers are charged with causing prices to be higher than they need to be. They are
sometimes accused of deceptive practices that lead consumers to believe they will get more
value than they actually do. Sometimes salespeople pressure consumers to purchase products
they neither want nor can afford. Others are accused of selling shoddy or unsafe products.
Others are blamed for developing products that become obsolete before they actually need
replacement. Last, marketers are accused of delivering poor service to disadvantaged
consumers or not making products available to them.

81) How do marketers respond to critics' accusations of planned obsolescence?
Answer: Marketers respond that consumers like style changes; they get tired of the old goods
and want a new look in fashion. Or they want the latest high-tech innovations, even if older
models still work. No one has to buy the new product, and if too few people like it, it will
simply fail. Finally, most companies do not design their products to break down earlier; they do
not want to lose customers to other brands. Instead, they seek constant improvement to ensure
that products will consistently meet or exceed customer expectations. Much of the so-called
planned obsolescence is the working of the competitive and technological forces in a free
society—forces that lead to ever-improving goods and services.

82) Identify the social costs of increased automobile ownership, and then describe two options
for restoring the balance between private and public goods. Give specific examples.
Answer: For cars, some of the social costs include traffic congestion, gasoline shortages, and
air pollution. One option for restoring the balance between private and public goods is to make
producers bear the full social costs of their operations. The government could require
automobile manufacturers to build cars with more efficient engines and better pollution control
systems. Automakers would then raise their prices to cover extra costs. A second option is to
make consumers pay the social costs. For example, many cities around the world are starting to
charge "congestion tolls" in an effort to reduce traffic congestion; drivers entering high-traffic
areas are required to pay a fee. Similarly, the U.S. government has recently proposed a bill that
would create rush-hour fees in congested urban areas across the country. If the costs of driving
increase enough, the government hopes, consumers will travel at nonpeak times or find
alternative transportation modes.

83) How do marketers respond to charges of "commercial noise"?
Answer: Marketers answer the charges of "commercial noise" with these arguments. First, they
hope that their ads reach primarily the target audience. But because of mass-communication
channels, some ads are bound to reach people who have no interest in the product and are
therefore bored or annoyed. People who buy magazines addressed to their interests—such as
Vogue or Fortune—rarely complain about the ads because the magazines advertise products of
interest. Second, ads make much of television and radio free to users and keep down the costs
of magazines and newspapers. Many people think commercials are a small price to pay for
these benefits. Consumers find many television commercials entertaining and seek them out—
for example, ad viewership during the Super Bowl usually equals game viewership. Finally,
today's consumers have alternatives. For example, they can zip or zap TV commercials on
recorded programs or avoid them altogether on many paid cable or satellite channels. Thus, to
hold consumer attention, advertisers are making their ads more entertaining and informative.

Answer: Student answers will vary to include new-clean technology and sustainability vision.
At the most basic level, a company can practice pollution prevention. This involves more than
pollution control or cleaning up waste after it has been created. Pollution prevention means
eliminating or minimizing waste before it is created. Companies emphasizing prevention have
responded with internal "green marketing" programs—designing and developing ecologically
safer products, recyclable and biodegradable packaging, better pollution controls, and more
energy-efficient operations. At the next level, companies can practice product stewardship—
minimizing not just pollution from production and product design but all environmental
impacts throughout the full product life cycle, all the while reducing costs. Many companies are
adopting design for environment (DFE) and cradle-to-cradle practices. This involves thinking
ahead to design products that are easier to recover, reuse, recycle, or safely return to nature after
usage, becoming part of the ecological cycle.

can plan for new clean technology. Many organizations that have made good sustainability
headway are still limited by existing technologies. To create fully sustainable strategies, they
will need to develop innovative new technologies. Companies can also develop a sustainability
vision, which serves as a guide to the future. It shows how the company's products and
services, processes, and policies must evolve and what new technologies must be developed to
get there. This vision of sustainability provides a framework for pollution control, product
stewardship, and new environmental technology for the company and others to follow.
